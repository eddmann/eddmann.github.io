<p>In a recent Software Engineering Daily <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/06/21/babel-with-henry-zhu/">podcast</a> Henry Zhu discussed the <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> project, and shed some light into how the transpiler works under-the-hood.
He touched upon how <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins.html">Plugins</a> can be created to alter the resulting compiled code.
I was very interested in experimenting with this capability.
In this post I wish to highlight the process in which Babel transforms your code, developing several interesting plugins along the way.
