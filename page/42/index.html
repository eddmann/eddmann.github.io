            <p>Having to use password authentication each time you wish to access your server can be a serious pain.
Not only does it require extra keystrokes, it is also less secure and far more susceptible to successful brute-force attacks.
Enter public-key authentication, were instead you use asymmetric cryptography.
The first thing to do is generate a key-pair on your client machine, you can optional provide a passphrase to unlock the private key if you so wish.</p>

            <p>Scala can be a very deceptive language, type-inference is a very good example of this.
Another less understood example that you will soon be welcome to upon closer exploration of the language is the ‘for-comprehension’.
The first point I wish to highlight is that in Scala everything is an expression which returns a value, even if this be Unit (which is equivalent to nothing).
This is a fundamental design principle of Scala which allows for productive use of its functional nature.
In an imperative manner for example, we have become very accustom to maybe declaring and assigning a default value, only to reassign it with another if a condition is meet on the next line.
Due to the expressive nature of the language this can instead be condensed into one-line, immutably and as a result less prone to error.</p>

            <p>I recently had the chance to rewrite the backend of my <a href="http://github.com/eddmann/eddmann">personal website</a>.
I was surprised at how accustom I had become to using heavy-weight web frameworks (with plenty of accompanying depencies) in larger projects I am involved in, that I instead decided to do the complete opposite.
As a result, I built a very simple single-page Markdown file-based blogging platform (inc. pagination, caching) that only takes a few moments to read.
I find myself sometimes being blinded by the need to abstract everything with the Object-oriented philosophy, never taking the time to consider that in many cases it pays off to keep things simple.
Simple, single purpose functions that can be used for multiple use-cases within your application is a very good mind-set to try and incorporate.
In this post I wish to discuss a couple of the functions that I created to keep the file so simple.</p>

            <p>It is good practise to open external links in a new window, however, it can be a bit tedious having to remember to include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'target="_blank"'</code>, especially in Markdown.
To get around this I have incorporated a simple raw JavaScript solution, which can be found below.</p>

            <p>When I re-designed my site earlier this year I wanted to include the last couple of twitter interactions in the footer.
Using v1.0 of the Twitter API this was a very simple process, giving access to a JSONP response with the publicly available tweets of a specified handle.
This all <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/discussions/11564">changed</a> in v1.1 with the introduction of required OAuth.
Fortunately, I was able to find a work-around <a href="http://jasonmayes.com/projects/twitterApi/">here</a> which took advantage of the response made available from a widget you create.
However, the returned tweets in this solution were already styled somewhat and I could not find a unminified version of the source.
So in the end I decided to spend 45 mins last night implementing my own solution.</p>
