<p>Following on from my previous post which discussed <a href="http://tech.mybuilder.com/memes-as-a-service-using-lambda-serverless-and-imagemagick/">manipulating images</a>, I would now like to expand upon this and look into how you can interact with audio using Lambda.
To highlight this use-case we will be creating a simple service which given a name and optional voice (provided by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">Polly</a>), will synthesise the name and include it in a returned ‘And the winner is…’ applause MP3 file.
This will demonstrate how to integrate Polly within Lambda, compile and execute native-code within Lambda and return a binary MP3 file to the client.
