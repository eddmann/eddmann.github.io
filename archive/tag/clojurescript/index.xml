It was so important to the war-time efforts that work carried out by Alan Turing at Bletchley Park to decode the resulting ciphers helped end the war.
For years I have been fascinated by this device, and I thought it would be interesting to explore implementing a web-based Enigma Machine using ClojureScript.
I also thought it would be a great opportunity to explore how I can use property-based testing to help garner confidence from the resulting implementation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Mystery Calculator in ClojureScript and Reagent</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/the-mystery-calculator-in-clojurescript-and-reagent/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/the-mystery-calculator-in-clojurescript-and-reagent/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Mystery Calculator is a commonly found Christmas cracker gift that uses a neat powers-of-two (binary) addition trick to fool the spectator.
I thought it would be interesting to create a small web application in &lt;a href="https://clojurescript.org/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">ClojureScript&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://reagent-project.github.io/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Reagent&lt;/a> that provides the ability to generate a selection of these cards and perform the trick.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
