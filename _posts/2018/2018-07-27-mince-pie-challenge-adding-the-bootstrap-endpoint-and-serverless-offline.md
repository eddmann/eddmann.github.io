Up until now, we have spent our time setting up the API project to provide a confident testing pipeline (with types) and Amazon Cognito authentication.
We will now move on to implementing the first **real** API endpoint, that being the Bootstrap response.
Along the way we will configure [Serverless Offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline), allowing us to locally interact with the API, without having to provision any online resources.
