On the seventeenth day of Advent of Code 2015, the elves bought 150 litres of eggnog that we are asked to fit in the supplied containers for refrigeration.

<!--more-->

## Part 1

We are supplied with a list of all the different-sized containers available to us as input, and for part one, we are asked how many combinations of these will fit the 150-litre requirement.
At its core, today centres around the [Subset Sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem), whereby given a [Multiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset), we are required to find all the possible subsets that sum to a given number (in this case, 150).
We begin by parsing the supplied containers into a form we can then process.

```typescript
const parseContainers = (input: string) =>
  input.split('\n').map(toInt);
```

There are several popular ways to solve the Subset Sum problem, each with its own complexity characteristics.
Due to the input being relatively small, I have opted for the native combinations approach, with a small optimisation to prune subsets that have already exceeded the desired total.
In the future, I hope to spend some time investigating how Dynamic Programming can help improve performance.

```typescript
const subsetSum = (numbers: number[], target: number): number[][] => {
  const recur = (remaining: number[], subset: number[]) => {
    const total = subset.reduce(sum, 0);
    if (total === target) return [subset];
    if (total >= target) return [];

    return remaining.flatMap((n, i) =>
      recur(remaining.slice(i + 1), [...subset, n])
    );
  };

  return recur(numbers, []);
};
```

The above implementation uses a recursive closure to iterate through all the possible subsets.
An optimisation I omitted would be to check upon each iteration whether the sum of the current total and remaining numbers is less than the target.
If this is the case, we can prune these branches, as we know that no following subset will meet the desired criteria.

Following on from this, I also spent some time implementing the same recursive approach using Generators.
I find that recursive problems such as this can be succinctly defined in this manner.

```typescript
function* subsetSum(
  numbers: number[],
  target: number
): Generator<number[]> {
  function* recur(remaining: number[], subset: number[]) {
    const total = subset.reduce(sum, 0);
    if (total === target) yield subset;
    if (total >= target) return;

    for (let i = 0; i < remaining.length; i++) {
      yield* recur(remaining.slice(i + 1), [...subset, remaining[i]]);
    }
  }

  yield* recur(numbers, []);
}
```

With the ability to now determine all the possible subsets that sum to the given number, we can answer the first part of today's problem ðŸŒŸ.

```typescript
const part1 = (input: string): number =>
  subsetSum(parseContainers(input), 150).length;
```

## Part 2

For part two, we are asked to investigate the possible subsets further, determining how many combinations of the least number of containers we can use.
Again, due to the search space being so small, we can harness the same functionality implemented in part one and construct an occurrences map per subset length.
With this occurrence mapping, we can then work out the smallest subset length present and return this count to answer part two ðŸŒŸ.

```typescript
const part2 = (input: string): number => {
  const sizes = subsetSum(parseContainers(input), 150).reduce(
    (sizes, subset) =>
      sizes.set(subset.length, (sizes.get(subset.length) || 0) + 1),
    new Map<number, number>()
  );

  return sizes.get(Math.min(...sizes.keys()));
};
```

As in part one, there are more performant solutions to achieving this end result.
In the future, I hope to explore the Subset Sum problem in more detail and investigate these options.
