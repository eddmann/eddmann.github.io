            <p>The Exclusive disjunction (or) swap algorithm is a little trick to swap values of equal data type without the use of a temporary variable.
Typically, low-level data types like integers are used in practice, but in theory any value represented by fixed-length <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">bit-strings</a> will work.
Though bad practice in most use-cases, it does help to highlight implementation details which can seem foreign to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">higher-level</a> programmers.
Due to the strong levels of abstraction put in place to help aid development of complicated systems we sometimes lose the beautify in working with the underlying bits and bytes.
An example of such an abstraction is the <a href="http://javabook.compuware.com/content/memory/how-garbage-collection-works.aspx">garbage collector</a> found in the JVM, which takes care of memory management concerns which in other lower-level languages would be of huge consideration.</p>

            <p>Radix sort is a O(digitsÂ·keys) sorting algorithm which relies on integer key grouping to successfully process and naturally order the specified data set.
Basing the sort on structure and positional notation, many other data types which can be represented in integer form (i.e. ASCII characters) can take advantage of the algorithm.
Sorting occurs by acting on the comparison between item digits in the same position.
Two alternative version of the algorithm exists, both tackling the problem from the opposite direction.
In this post I will be describing an iterative lowest significant digit implementation which as the name hints at, starts processing from the right most digit position.
This implementation results in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_sort#Stability">stable</a> sort, where as the other implementation, tackles the most significant digit first and can not make such guarantees.
In a stable sorting algorithm the initial ordering of equal keys is left unchanged in the result.</p>

            <p>Partial function application is a common place feature found in many languages that lean towards the functional paradigm.
Unlike some functional concepts (monads) it can be simply explained as taking a function and binding argument values to one or more of its parameters, resulting in a new function.
Function argument size in computer science circles is described as its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity">arity</a>, and through this process we are reducing the arity based on the partial application call.
Discussion of partial application typically brings up the related topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a>, which follows the stricter rule of transforming a multiple argument function into a chain of single argument calls.
This is useful as it helps simplify the study of functions in theoretical computer sciences, such as lambda calculus.
Currying however is not that useful in general-purpose languages, dissimilar to Haskell which at its core only supports the mathematical notion of single argument functions.
Using a combination of syntactic sugar and currying, the language is able to give the misguided impression of multi-argument calls, when in-fact it is just a chain of single argument curried calls.</p>

            <p>Following on from my previous post on implementing a <a href="/posts/implementing-a-stack-in-java-using-arrays-and-linked-lists/">stack</a> in Java, I now wish to discuss the as important queue data-structure.
Similar in kind to the restrictions placed upon the stack implementation, the queue only allows mutation via two methods.
Addition (enqueue) occurs at the end of the collection, and removal (dequeue) from the beginning, resulting in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure.
Queues are typically used in the application of buffers to store data, objects, events etc. that are to be held for future sequential processing.
Discussed in the post on stacks, you are more than likely never going to have to implement such a data-structure in practical use-cases, as the language libraries will already include such an implementation (i.e. <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/">C++ STL</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splqueue.php">PHP SplQueue</a>).</p>

            <p>The Shunting Yard algorithm was developed by the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra">Edsger Dijkstra</a> as a means to parse an infix mathematical expression into Reverse Polish notation (postfix).
Using said notation allows the computer to evaluate the expression in a simple stack based form, <a href="/posts/reverse-polish-notation-rpn-in-scala/">examples</a> of which I have shown in Scala.
The algorithm itself also uses a stack along with a built-up output string to create the resulting value.
Below is an example implementation which only takes into consideration bracket and the four common operator precedences.
Although it is possible to evaluate more, including functions and associativity, I decided on keeping the implementation simple to better highlight the process.</p>
