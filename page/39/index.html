            <p>Tools such as <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AWStats</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/logstalgia/">Logstalgia</a> are great, but sometimes they can be over-kill for the problem we are trying to solve.
It turns out that with a couple of simple Unix commands we can gather a lot of useful information from the data stored in our the access logs.
Both Apache and Nginx by default use the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#combined">combined</a> log format which I will be basing this posts examples on.
Below are two different methods of accessing either an uncompressed single file or multiple compressed files (following the supplied wild-card pattern).</p>

            <h2 id="bit-flags">Bit Flags</h2>

<p>Bit flags, commonly referred to as Bit fields are an efficient way of storing several related boolean values in a single primitive type.
Internally represented in binary, you can decide on how large the storage type needs to be - for example, a Java integer will provide you with space for 31 flags.
Being a 32 bit type you would assume to have access to this many flags, however, due to it being a signed value the most significant bit is reserved to store its +/- sign.</p>

            <p>I recently wanted to create a simple function in JavaScript which allowed me to generate a random background colour for a small <a href="http://workshop.eddmann.com/copacabana/">experiment</a> I was working on.
The implementation I came up with worked very well, but the decimal-hexadecimal representation conversion was all wrapped up in one ‘toString(16)’ function call.
I was very interested in how I could go about creating this method myself and decided on the Java language for the attempt.
The discussed functionality is already present in the Java language to, within the ‘java.lang.Integer’ class as ‘toHexString’.</p>

            <p>Continuing on with my exploration of the Scala language I decided to solve the widely documented problem of evaluating a mathematical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation">Reverse Polish notation</a> string.
Popularised by its use in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-10C_series">HP-10C</a> series of calculators from the 1980’s, the notation requires that every operator follow its operands (otherwise called postfix notation).</p>

            <p>Git has two different types of timestamp associated with a commit.
Although both may typically hold the same value they are used in subtly different ways.
The author (GIT_AUTHOR_DATE) is the user who originally created the work (i.e. a patch), where as the committer (GIT_COMMITTER_DATE) is the user who last applied the work (i.e. applied patch or rebase).
The author date is the one displayed when the log is accessed, however, the commit date is used when given the filter (–since, –until) options, which seems a little odd.
To avoid confusion you can include the committer date within your log display by setting the –format option.</p>
