            <p>In the <a href="http://threedevsandamaybe.com/the-one-hundredth-episode/">100th episode</a> of Three Devs and a Maybe I decided to generate some stats relating to the previous 99 episodes and formed a small quiz out of these findings.
All information relating to each podcast is stored in separate Markdown files within YAML front-matter, which makes it easy to pull out and process.
I thought it would be interesting to go over the code I used to achieve this.</p>

            <p>Yesterday I watched a conference talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saMtzIaDCJM">Formal Logic</a> and De Morgan’s laws were discussed.
Wikipedia does a very good job of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">explaining the laws</a> in-depth, but essentially they are transformation rules that allow you to simplify certain propositions.
Whilst programming, predicate logic of this form appears very frequently, and it is very useful to know how you can rewrite a predicate to better describe its intent.</p>

            <p>Last week I was required to validate that a supplied integer would fit correctly into a 32-bit address space.
The available size of an integer within PHP is platform dependent, and could either be 32 or 64 bits based on the architecture you are using.
This function had to cater for these differences and as such I decided to explore a couple of different options for producing this validation.</p>

            <p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/720432624548900864">tweet</a> from Adam Wathan highlighting one of the examples in his <a href="http://adamwathan.me/refactoring-to-collections/">upcoming book</a>, he demonstrated breaking down the process of converting from binary to decimal representation using a pipeline of transformations.
I thought it would again be interesting to see how I would go about performing this process in JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Recently I have been looking more into SQL and in-particular how RDMS’s work under-the-hood.
I thought it would be interesting to use some of the lesser-known features that PostgreSQL has to offer, concentrating my efforts on operations performed on a deck of cards.</p>
