This morning I stumbled upon an issue surrounding checking for the existence of a variable in JavaScript.
<!--more-->
I was under the impression that I could perform this check as follows:

```js
const isPresent = foo !== undefined;
// ReferenceError: foo is not defined
```

Looking at the code above you will notice that this did not work, and instead a ReferenceError exception was thrown.
This is due to the JavaScript specification stating that an exception of this kind should be thrown when trying to dereference a variable that has not yet been declared.
Upon review however I was able to resolve this issue by being more specific in our check, like so:

```js
const isPresent = window.foo !== undefined;
```

This implementation works as the initial variable that we are dereferencing (`window`) exists, and instead the check is now preformed on the windows value (an object) instead.
An object in JavaScript returns `undefined` when trying to access a non-existent property.
This check however, can seem a little limited in scope, so instead the more generic (and recommended) way for checking if a variable has been defined or not is as follows.

```js
const isPresent = typeof foo !== 'undefined';
```
