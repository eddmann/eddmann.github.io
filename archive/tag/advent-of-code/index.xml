After my recent exploration into &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/">PWAs&lt;/a> this past year, I wanted a reason to explore Kotlin and Swift, two languages equipped for native mobile (Android and iOS) development.
Before delving into the mobile domain, I wanted to see what each language had to offer.
In this post, I will document my experience completing the Advent of Code 2023 calendar in both &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/kotlin" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Kotlin&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/swift" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Swift&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solving the Advent of Code 2022 calendar using my own programming language, santa-lang</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2022-calendar-using-my-own-programming-language-santa-lang/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2022-calendar-using-my-own-programming-language-santa-lang/</guid><description>&lt;p>December has come and gone, and the dust has settled on completing the Advent of Code 2022 calendar.
As highlighted in my &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/designing-santa-lang-a-language-for-solving-advent-of-code-puzzles/">previous post&lt;/a>, I wanted to complete this year&amp;rsquo;s puzzles using my own programming language, santa-lang, which I have tailored to help aid in solving such problems.
In this post, I want to discuss this experience, how the language aided in solution development, and where additions or changes were made to improve it along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Designing santa-lang, a language for solving Advent of Code puzzles</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/designing-santa-lang-a-language-for-solving-advent-of-code-puzzles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/designing-santa-lang-a-language-for-solving-advent-of-code-puzzles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past several years, I have been slowly working &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2015" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">my&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2016/python" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">way&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017/rust" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">through&lt;/a> the previous Advent of Code calendars.
For each calendar, I opt to solve the puzzles in a new programming language to familiarise myself with other ways of understanding and working.
However, there comes a time in each calendar when I grow to dislike some aspect of the language.
So I had an idea&amp;hellip; why not give this whole programming language design a go?
That way, if I grow to dislike the language, I only have myself to blame!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solving the Advent of Code 2021 calendar on a Raspberry Pi Pico</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2021-calendar-on-a-raspberry-pi-pico/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2021-calendar-on-a-raspberry-pi-pico/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past year or so, I have been interested in microcontrollers and finding ways I can look to &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-2fa-totp-generator-using-a-raspberry-pi-pico-and-micropython/">use them&lt;/a> within personal projects.
Having just completed the &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2021-calendar-using-c-in-under-half-a-second/">Advent of Code 2021&lt;/a> calendar in C, I thought it would be interesting to see how many of these solutions I could get to run on the constrained hardware of a Raspberry Pi Pico.
In this article, I will discuss how I went about achieving this, presenting the solutions&amp;rsquo; answers on a &lt;a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack?variant=32368664215635" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Pimoroni Display&lt;/a> via an interactive menu (with paging).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solving the Advent of Code 2021 calendar using C in under half-a-second</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2021-calendar-using-c-in-under-half-a-second/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2021-calendar-using-c-in-under-half-a-second/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since being introduced to the world of &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Advent of Code&lt;/a> just prior to the 2020 calendar starting, I subsequently spent the majority of 2021 completing (and documenting) the &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/archive/tag/advent-of-code-2015">2015&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/archive/tag/advent-of-code-2016">2016&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017/rust" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">2017&lt;/a> calendars.
For the 2021 calendar, I decided that it would be interesting (and challenging) to complete the calendar in C, with an initial solution written in Python to meet the daily aspect of the challenge.
Additionally, with C being such a performant language, I also wanted to set the goal of ensuring that the entire C calendar was solvable on a single CPU core in under half a second (inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.dannyvankooten.com/blog/2021/solving-advent-of-code-2020-under-1-second/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">this&lt;/a> blog post).
In this post, I wish to discuss how I went about achieving this goal (&lt;em>spoiler&lt;/em>: &lt;code>410315 μs (0.410 s)&lt;/code> on average) and the hurdles I faced along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Advent of Code 2016 -

What initially started out as completing each daily 2020 puzzle &lt;em>in my own time&lt;/em> soon turned into a daily obsession, and in turn, an incredible learning experience shared amongst the team.&lt;/p>

Over the coming months, I hope to record each of my solutions, with the goal of completing all the previous puzzles just in time for the 2021 calendar to commence.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
