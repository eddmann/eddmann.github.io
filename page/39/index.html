            <p>Since adding the functionality to process syntax highlighting through <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> I had been on the look out for similar external tools I could integrate.
One area that I felt was lacking in my posts was accompanying visual aids, which would be useful when explaining a new concept or algorithm.
Like most developers I feel at home in an editor, so delving into another software package did not appeal to me.</p>

            <p>Memoization is a simple optimisation technique to understand and in most cases implement.
The base idea is to speed up function calls by avoiding the re-calculation of previously processed input results (very cache-like).
Storing these results in a key-value lookup store can result in major speed increases when repetitive function calls occur.</p>

            <p>When you first take a look at <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> you may ask yourself, what is with all the static?
It is a valid question, as on the surface it can seem like the framework is heavily static method based.
However, this could be no further from the truth, a deeper exploration reveals that the static calls we make really mask a great amount of instance objects.
In this post I hope to provide a simple explanation as to what is really going on, and along the way build a basic implementation to practice these new found findings.</p>

            <p>Having a website that is heavily software-development based, one important aspect that can not be overlooked is well presented code examples.
Speaking on the importance of editor syntax highlighting in the <a href="http://threedevsandamaybe.com/posts/exploring-text-source-editors-and-ides/">previous episode</a> of our podcast, this attribute transcends over to aid in the readability of code online.
Fortunately, there are many options to choose from, whether it is storing the code snippets in an embedded <a href="http://gist.github.com/">Gists</a> or using the front-end based <a href="http://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">Google Code Prettify</a>.
One benefit that greatly simpled the publishing process when using a front-end based solution was that you could simply parse the Markdown file (maybe with a class language type-hint), and leave all the hard work for the clientâ€™s browser.
As we all know, we have very little control over the viewing experience per user, and as I have started to post more frequently, cracks began to appear in the syntax highlighters I had been using.
However, when looking for a solution, one had been staring me straight in the face all this time, that being <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>.</p>

            <p>Heapsort is a sorting algorithm which can be split into two distinct stages.
The first stage is to build a tree-based heap data structure from the supplied input.
Conforming to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap">heap property</a> either requires the structure follow that all parent nodes are greater than or equal to their children (with the highest at the root), or the inverse.</p>
