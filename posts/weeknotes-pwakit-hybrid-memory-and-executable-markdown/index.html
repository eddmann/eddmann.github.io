I love them.
Android support is excellent - PWAs feel genuinely native there.
But iOS is lagging behind, and having an App Store presence matters.
It&rsquo;s where the eyeballs are, it&rsquo;s where people discover apps, and even though you can make a web experience feel like a native app using PWAs, being <em>in the store</em> is a different thing entirely.</p><p>The beauty of PWAs is that <strong>you control the deployment</strong>.
Offline strategies, syncing, pushing new fixes - all without going through an app release cycle.
That fluidity is brilliant.
But you still need that thin native wrapper to get into the App Store.</p><p>I&rsquo;d been using <a href=https://www.pwabuilder.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>PWABuilder</a> for this over the past year - wrapping <a href=https://chessmate.cloud/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Chessmate</a>, <a href=https://namethatcolor.cloud/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Name That Color</a>, and <a href=https://dailything.cloud/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Daily Thing</a> for distribution.
PWABuilder gave me that wrapper, and it worked.
But the source felt dated.
It wasn&rsquo;t leveraging SwiftUI, there were gaps I kept patching - notification tweaks, missing features, rough edges.
I found myself adding the same things on top every time.</p><p>So I built <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/pwa-kit rel="external noopener" target=_blank>PWAKit</a> from the ground up.</p><p>The core principle: keep everything as web-standard as possible.
I didn&rsquo;t want to learn a new framework or rewrite anything.
I wanted to write my web app the way I already write web apps, and have a thin native shell that gets it into the App Store.
I&rsquo;ve <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/pwa-kit/blob/main/docs/comparison.md rel="external noopener" target=_blank>written up comparisons</a> with Capacitor, React Native, Flutter, and native Swift - each has tradeoffs, but for my use case the PWA-first approach wins for most usecases.</p><p>The way it works is you supply a URL and the list of native features you want available in the wrapper.
The CLI (<code>npx @pwa-kit/cli init</code>) scaffolds an Xcode project with those modules enabled, and a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/pwa-kit/tree/main/sdk rel="external noopener" target=_blank>TypeScript SDK</a> provides the JavaScript bridge between your web app and the native layer.
I built modules for the things I actually needed across my apps (i.e. HealthKit, haptics, notifications&mldr;), and ended up with fifteen of them.
It also provides capabilities for you to expand the wrapper and write your own native modules if desired.</p><p>One thing I&rsquo;m particularly pleased with: <strong>it reads your web manifest</strong>.
Theme colour, background colour, app name, app icon - if you&rsquo;ve already done the work to make a <em>proper</em> PWA, the wrapper just picks it up.
That felt right.
The wrapper should be as invisible as possible.</p><p>The feature modules are currently enabled at runtime based on config.
I&rsquo;d like to move this to compile-time eventually - Swift macros to only include what you need - but runtime works for now.</p><p>I also built a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/pwa-kit/tree/main/example rel="external noopener" target=_blank><strong>Kitchen Sink demo</strong></a> that exercises every module.
It&rsquo;s mostly for my own testing and validation, but it doubles as a way to explore how each feature actually behaves on device.</p><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/pwa-kit-splash_hu_6fb74c0e767c432d.webp 350w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/pwa-kit-splash_hu_f50e84d7f80a54f9.webp 700w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/pwa-kit-splash_hu_19eb58e132dd3085.webp 1179w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/pwa-kit-splash_hu_99cc0f180fb963b3.jpg 350w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/pwa-kit-splash_hu_238a9a08f8b772d9.jpg 700w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/pwa-kit-splash_hu_785cb5979b4d716b.jpg 1179w"><img src=/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/pwa-kit-splash_hu_238a9a08f8b772d9.jpg alt="PWAKit splash screen" loading=lazy>

But <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/step-wars rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Step Wars</a> was the real dog-fooding exercise.</p><p>Step Wars needed three things from the native layer: <strong>haptic feedback</strong>, <strong>local notifications</strong>, and <strong>HealthKit</strong>.</p><p>The HealthKit integration was the most interesting addition.
Step Wars can now query iOS HealthKit directly - current step counts, yesterday&rsquo;s totals, whatever the challenge needs - and upload them automatically.
No manual entry.
It starts to feel like a <em>real</em> native app.
Like opening Garmin Connect or the Health app on your phone - the data just syncs and it works.</p><p>Haptic feedback handles the confirmations - that satisfying vibration when you submit your steps, confirm an action.
Small touches that make the experience feel native.</p><p>And local notifications send a daily reminder at 8am to make sure you&rsquo;ve uploaded your steps.
I&rsquo;m planning to expand this to push notifications from the backend eventually - alerts when a challenge is ending and you haven&rsquo;t submitted, that kind of thing.
But local notifications are a good start.</p><p>What I like about this setup is that the web app doesn&rsquo;t change.
You can still enter steps manually in a browser - the PWA works as it always did.
The native features just layer on top when you&rsquo;re on iOS.
It&rsquo;s additive, not a rewrite.</p><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/step-wars-healthkit_hu_76994e254b83aceb.webp 350w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/step-wars-healthkit_hu_ea934a039f27f482.webp 700w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/step-wars-healthkit_hu_61f35d9021ac26cf.webp 1179w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/step-wars-healthkit_hu_530a1d67fe56f99.jpg 350w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/step-wars-healthkit_hu_c20e10b2a11abba7.jpg 700w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/step-wars-healthkit_hu_5ccc710b2e25a09b.jpg 1179w"><img src=/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/step-wars-healthkit_hu_c20e10b2a11abba7.jpg alt="Step Wars with HealthKit integration" loading=lazy></picture></p><h2 id=coding-agent-refactoring-with-gpt53codex>Coding Agent: Refactoring with GPT‑5.3‑Codex</h2><p>I continued refactoring <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/my-own-coding-agent rel="external noopener" target=_blank>My Own Coding Agent</a> this week, with two big threads: testing philosophy and model support.</p><p>On the testing side, I noticed the existing coverage was leaning heavily into <strong>implementation details</strong> - the London school approach.
Mocking internals, asserting on how things were called - I wanted to move toward <strong>Detroit/Chicago-style</strong> coverage.
Test at the public API boundary, double the external collaborators, and let the tests tell you <em>what</em> broke rather than just <em>that</em> something moved.</p><p>This is the approach <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM" rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Ian Cooper</a> and Kent Beck advocate for, and it&rsquo;s what I described <a href=../2026-02-08-weeknotes-throwaway-tools-sessions-as-trees-and-building-a-personal-ai-assistant/>last week</a> with F1 Picks and Step Wars.</p><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that this testing refactoring also improved the architecture.
Thinking carefully about what constitutes a public API boundary forces you to think about module boundaries, dependency direction, and what&rsquo;s actually stable.
Better tests led to better structure.</p><p>The other thread was model support.
I added <strong><a href=https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>GPT‑5.3‑Codex</a></strong> support at the beginning of the week, which means you can now use your ChatGPT subscription with the agent.
I also revisited <strong>OpenRouter</strong> support and played with local language models - using OpenRouter as an OpenAI-compatible LLM provider, and running models locally using <a href=https://ollama.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Ollama</a>.
Documented all of that too, which was a satisfying exercise in itself.</p><p>The workflow from previous weeks continues to evolve but the shape is the same.
<strong>Opus 4.6 for quick iteration</strong> - tight REPL loops, tracer bullets, fast feedback.
<strong>GPT‑5.3‑Codex for big architectural thinking</strong> - structural changes, refactoring, rethinking boundaries.
The new GPT‑5.3‑Codex gave me a great opportunity to exercise this: using it for the testing refactoring, letting it reason about module boundaries and test design while I focused on direction.</p><p>One observation that keeps surprising me: <strong>I don&rsquo;t think about context windows anymore</strong> when working with GPT‑5.3‑Codex.
I just talk.
The compaction is intelligent enough that I don&rsquo;t see regressions even in long sessions with big architectural changes.
The model maintains coherence across compaction boundaries in a way that feels seamless.
I could be making big structural changes, splitting modules, reorganising tests - and the model tracks it all through compaction without missing a beat.</p><h2 id=jeeves-hybrid-memory-and-multimodal>Jeeves: Hybrid Memory and Multimodal</h2><p>I managed to spend a little more time on <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/jeeves rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Jeeves</a> this week, building on the conversation I had with <a href=https://tjmiller.me/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>TJ Miller</a> about memory last week.</p><p>The biggest addition is the <strong>long-term memory system</strong> - a hybrid search index using SQLite.
<a href=https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html rel="external noopener" target=_blank>FTS5</a> handles keyword search, and <a href=https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec rel="external noopener" target=_blank><code>sqlite-vec</code></a> provides native vector similarity search using OpenAI embeddings.
This is wired into a context compaction pipeline so the agent can summarise and persist knowledge from long conversations.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve ended up somewhere close to what <a href=https://openclaw.ai/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>OpenClaw</a> does at the moment, with a couple of ideas I&rsquo;m working on that expand beyond it.
The combination of lexical and semantic search means Jeeves can find relevant memories whether I use the exact same words or just related concepts.</p><p>Beyond memory, I added <strong>new tools</strong> - edit tools, web search - and made Jeeves <strong>multimodal</strong>.
You can now send photos, voice messages, and reply to previous messages with context.
Jeeves understands all of these, which opens up much richer interactions than pure text.</p><p>I also fixed some internal details around caching with the Anthropic API - an interesting one where stale <code>cache_control</code> markers were causing issues with the block limit.</p><p>Next step: making it bidirectional.
I want Jeeves to be able to <em>send</em> photos and voice messages back, not just receive them.
Full conversational multimedia.</p><h2 id=compiled-conversations-chris-brousseau>Compiled Conversations: Chris Brousseau</h2><p>I released <a href=https://compiledconversations.com/19/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>episode 19</a> of Compiled Conversations this week - a conversation with <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-brousseau/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Chris Brousseau</a>, co-author of <a href=https://www.manning.com/books/llms-in-production rel="external noopener" target=_blank><em>LLMs in Production</em></a> and VP of AI at Veox AI.
I&rsquo;m a big fan of his book, and this was a conversation I recorded at the tail end of last year that I finally got around to releasing.</p><p>What made this episode special was Chris&rsquo;s path into LLMs.
He came from <strong>linguistics</strong> - semiotics, translation, how meaning is created in language.
A graduate seminar on Python and machine translation in 2017 pulled him into NLP, and that linguistic foundation gives him a fundamentally different lens on what these models can and can&rsquo;t do.</p><p>We went deep.
The fundamentals - transformers, tokenisation, word embeddings, the training pipeline from self-supervised learning through RLHF to supervised fine-tuning.
The production side - lessons from deploying multi billion-parameter models at MasterCard and JP Morgan Chase, the gap between demos and real systems.
And some fascinating tangents: how logic manipulation and context-free grammars can make a 2023-era 7B model outperform frontier models at maths, the evolution from prompt engineering to context engineering, and the stochastic parrots debate through the lens of semiotics.</p><p>What I really wanted from this episode was a conversation that went deeper into the LLM stuff than the usual surface-level takes, and Chris delivered.
The linguistics background provides a grounding that&rsquo;s rare in these discussions - understanding both the strengths and the fundamental limitations of language models.</p><h2 id=executable-markdown-and-the-trust-problem>Executable Markdown and the Trust Problem</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2otN_NY75Y" rel="external noopener" target=_blank>ThePrimeagen&rsquo;s video on skills</a> this week articulated something that&rsquo;s been nagging at me.</p><p><strong>Prompt injection is the SQL injection of the agentic era.</strong></p><p>In traditional security, we learned the hard way to separate code and data.
SQL injection happens when you treat them as the same thing - user input flows directly into executable queries.
The solution was clear: parameterised queries, prepared statements, sanitise your inputs.
Separate the channels.</p><p>But with LLMs, we&rsquo;re back to the same fundamental problem.
A prompt is <em>both</em> instruction and data.
The system prompt, the user&rsquo;s request, the context from tools and files - it&rsquo;s all mixed together in one stream that the model interprets holistically.
There&rsquo;s no clean separation between what&rsquo;s &ldquo;code&rdquo; (the instructions) and what&rsquo;s &ldquo;data&rdquo; (the content being processed).</p><p>And skills make this worse.
A skill is a Markdown file.
<strong>Markdown as an executable.</strong>
When you pull down a skill from a hub - if you haven&rsquo;t read it, haven&rsquo;t verified it - you&rsquo;re essentially running an untrusted executable on your machine.</p><p>The examples from the video are sobering: malicious instructions hidden in comments that don&rsquo;t render in GitHub-style review but agents faithfully follow, and hallucinated npm packages that an attacker could squat on.</p><p>Peter Steinberger is working on verification for the OpenClaw skill hub - scanning and checking that skills are safe.
But this is fundamentally hard.
All the basic principles of security - least privilege, defence in depth, separation of concerns - get blurred in the agentic world.</p><p>Because here&rsquo;s the tension: <strong>security is friction, and usefulness comes from giving agents access</strong>.
The magic happens when you let agents operate mostly autonomously with broad access to your machine, your codebase, your services.
But that&rsquo;s exactly the access an injected prompt would exploit.</p><p>Simon Willison calls this the <strong><a href=https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>lethal trifecta</a></strong>: an agent that can read private data, take actions (send emails, execute code), <em>and</em> process untrusted content.
Any two of those are manageable; all three together and a successful prompt injection becomes a full compromise.
Jeeves pointed this out to me itself, unprompted - it ticks all three boxes.</p><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/jeeves-lethal-trifecta_hu_70520c9aced9e24f.webp 350w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/jeeves-lethal-trifecta_hu_c2a8ff6b9d1d4688.webp 700w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/jeeves-lethal-trifecta_hu_836dfbd7959d8dad.webp 1179w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/jeeves-lethal-trifecta_hu_1fe07c75b649cf6a.jpg 350w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/jeeves-lethal-trifecta_hu_bbcd242e4772194d.jpg 700w, /posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/jeeves-lethal-trifecta_hu_c891b2863eb2ca4f.jpg 1179w"><img src=/posts/weeknotes-pwakit-hybrid-memory-and-executable-markdown/jeeves-lethal-trifecta_hu_bbcd242e4772194d.jpg alt="Jeeves discussing the lethal trifecta" loading=lazy></picture></p><p>We need to be thinking about this seriously as the ecosystem matures.

Thorsten Ball says he&rsquo;s the bottleneck now.
ThePrimeagen points out that the security model assumes a human in the loop - but we keep removing the human to get the speed.</p><p>I feel this tension every day.
The productivity gains from letting agents run autonomously are real - PWAKit, the test refactoring, the Jeeves memory system, all of it moves faster when I step back and let the model work.
But stepping back means trusting.
And trust in a world of executable markdown and prompt injection requires a kind of vigilance that&rsquo;s new to our discipline.</p><p>We haven&rsquo;t figured this out yet.
But at least we&rsquo;re talking about it.</p></main><footer class=post-footer><ul class="tags tags--large"><li><a href=/archive/tag/weeknotes>weeknotes</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/agents>agents</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/personal-software>personal-software</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/pwa>pwa</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/llm>llm</a></li></ul><div class=related><h3 class=related__title>Related Posts</h3><ul class=related__posts><li><a href=/posts/weeknotes-throwaway-tools-sessions-as-trees-and-building-a-personal-ai-assistant/>Weeknotes: Throwaway Tools, Sessions as Trees, and Building a Personal AI Assistant</a></li><li><a href=/posts/weeknotes-model-personalities-building-my-own-agent-and-two-schools-of-agentic-development/>Weeknotes: Model Personalities, Building My Own Agent, and Two Schools of Agentic Development</a></li><li><a href=/posts/weeknotes-from-mcp-to-skills-buns-phpx-and-personal-software/>Weeknotes: From MCP to Skills, buns, phpx, and the Rise of Personal Software</a></li><li><a href=/posts/running-mcps-everywhere-chatting-with-my-workouts/>Running MCPs Everywhere: Chatting with My Workouts</a></li><li><a href=/posts/contextual-movie-conversations-building-a-plex-mcp-server/>Contextual Movie Conversations: Building a Plex MCP Server</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><div class="podcast-ad u-overlay-wrapper"><div class=podcast-ad__artwork><img src=https://compiledconversations.com/album-art.jpg alt="Compiled Conversations podcast album art" class=podcast-ad__artwork-image></div><div class=podcast-ad__content><h3 class=podcast-ad__title>Compiled Conversations</h3><p class=podcast-ad__description>Podcast I host, featuring conversations with the people shaping software and technology.</p><div class=podcast-ad__link>Check out the show</a></div><a class=u-overlay href=https://compiledconversations.com target=_blank>Listen to Compiled Conversations</a></div><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer l-wrapper"><div>&copy; 2026, Edd Mann</div><button class=site-footer__theme-toggle type=button title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg fill="currentcolor" viewBox="0 0 32 32" role="img"><title>Theme toggle icon</title><desc>A circle representing the moon for toggling theme</desc><path d="M16 .5C7.4.5.5 7.4.5 16S7.4 31.5 16 31.5 31.5 24.6 31.5 16 24.6.5 16 .5zm0 28.1V3.4C23 3.4 28.6 9 28.6 16S23 28.6 16 28.6z"/></svg></button></footer></body></html>
