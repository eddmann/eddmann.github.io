This past December, a [fellow colleague](https://github.com/tomcant) introduced us to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
What initially started out as completing each daily 2020 puzzle _in my own time_ soon turned into a daily obsession, and in turn, an incredible learning experience shared amongst the team.

Having completed the 2020 calendar at the end of last year, over the past couple of weeks we have begun working through the previous calendars.
Over the coming months, I hope to record each of my solutions, with the goal of completing all the previous puzzles just in time for the 2021 calendar to commence.

## Part 1

And so the journey begins...

The first part of today's puzzle centres around determining what floor Santa will be on based on the supplied directions.
Parsing the input is trivial, but as we have the power of TypeScript behind us, we can also provide an element of type-safety.

```typescript
enum Direction {
  Up = '(',
  Down = ')',
}

const parseDirections = (input: string): Direction[] =>
  [...input].filter((d: string): d is Direction =>
    Object.values(Direction).includes(d as Direction)
  );
```

In this instance, we simply remove any invalid directions that do not conform to our expected input.
Alternatively, we could have thrown an exception so as to not silently ignore invalid input.

With the input now parsed into an expected form, we can determine which floor Santa will end up on.

```typescript
const part1 = (input: string): number =>
  parseDirections(input).reduce(
    (floor, direction) => floor + (direction === Direction.Up ? 1 : -1),
    0
  );
```

This can be achieved using a single reduction that keeps track of what floor Santa is currently on.
Once we have reduced over all the directions, we can return the resulting floor ðŸŒŸ.

Upon reflection of my initial solution, I noticed that this could be simplified into just subtracting the total _Down_ directions from the _Up_ directions.
Opting for the `split` method over the `RegExp` method to count occurrences, you would usually be required to decrement the result by one to get the correct answer.
However, using the same method for both cancels this out for the final answer.

```typescript
const part1 = (input: string): number =>
  input.split('(').length - input.split(')').length;
```

## Part 2

In the second part of today's puzzle, we are asked to answer a different question based on the same supplied input.
We are now required to work out at which direction's position (one-indexed) Santa first enters the basement (`-1`).

```typescript
const part2 = (input: string): number => {
  let floor = 0;

  for (const [position, direction] of parseDirections(input).entries()) {
    floor += direction === Direction.Up ? 1 : -1;
    if (floor < 0) return position + 1;
  }

  throw new Error('Santa never enters the basement');
};
```

To solve this problem, I opted to replace the reduction with a conventional _for loop_, which allows us to return the first time we see Santa enter the basement (negative floor value).
As the array index supplied by `Array.prototype.entries()` is zero-indexed, we are required to increment this value by one to produce the desired position ðŸŒŸ.
