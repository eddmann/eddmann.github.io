            <p>I recently decided to test my novice C skills in the field of building a PHP extension.
However, despite some very good resources (<a href="http://www.phpinternalsbook.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/303/extension-writing-part-i-introduction-to-php-and-zend/">here</a>), there still seems to be a lack of beginner-friendly material on the subject.
In this post I will be documenting a simple development environment that has worked well on a fresh CentOS 6.5 installation.
Once this has been setup, we will then move on to creating a simple ‘Hello World’ extension, highlighting some of the extension platforms capabilities.</p>

            <p>Iterative deepening depth-first search (IDDFS) is an extension to the ‘vanilla’ depth-first search algorithm, with an added constraint on the total depth explored per iteration.
This addition produces equivalent results to what can be achieved using breadth-first search, without suffering from the large memory costs.
Due to BFS’s storage of fringe vertices in memory, Od^b memory space may be required (b = branching factor), this is a stark contrast to IDDFS’s O(bd) worst-case memory requirements.
On a per-iteration interval vertex successors at the depth-cap level are ignored, and if the goal has not been found, the maximum level is increased (by one) and the processes repeated.
Similarly to BFS, it has the guarantee to find an optimal path between two subject vertices, as the shallowest goal vertex will be the depth-cap first, resulting in no exploration of subsequent, unnecessary branches.</p>

            <p>Graph theory and in particular the graph ADT (abstract data-type) is widely explored and implemented in the field of Computer Science and Mathematics.
Consisting of vertices (nodes) and the edges (optionally directed/weighted) that connect them, the data-structure is effectively able to represent and solve many problem domains.
One of the most popular areas of algorithm design within this space is the problem of checking for the existence or (shortest) path between two or more vertices in the graph.</p>

            <p>Whilst uploading the <a href="http://threedevsandamaybe.com/">weekly podcast</a> I am required to produce a list of links we discussed about on the show.
This can get a little tiresome, visiting each link and finding a suitable title.
Along with this, using Markdown you are required to provide lists in a specific format.
I had been doing this manually for a couple of weeks and last night I thought, I am a developer, I should not be doing unnecessary work.</p>

            <p>With my recent dedicated introduction to the Python language I have become very appreciative of the highly composable nature of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface">WSGI</a> applications.
In a functional style you are able to compose a desired application from many different components, using the middleware ideology.
The benefits of this approach can be clearly seen in the contrived example depicted below, which is based on my previous <a href="/posts/using-basic-auth-and-decorators-in-pythons-flask/">Flask example</a>.</p>
