The origin of the data does not concern Sphinx, as interaction with the data source is abstracted by the many drivers available.
Currently, built-in to the product are drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC-compliant databases and the ability to parse XML-formatted streams (via pipes).
It must be noted, however, that each data record is required to have a single unique field ID.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
