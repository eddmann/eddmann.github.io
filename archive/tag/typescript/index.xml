For the past several months, I have been interested in the concept of Progressive Web Applications (thanks in large part to &lt;a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pwas/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">this series&lt;/a>), and getting more hands-on experience with the ever-changing frontend landscape.
As such, I decided that this year I would build a small application that works across Desktop, iOS, and Android to perform Secret Santa draws in both a local and remote setting.
In this post, I would like to document how I went about building this application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Running Calculator PWA in React and TypeScript</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been an avid runner for many years now, but I still get confused by imperial and metric measurements.
On top of this, the number of times I seek out a random website to perform some form of pace/distance calculation is too often to count.
What I wanted was a desktop and mobile application that could perform pace, distance, and time calculations, along with imperial/metric conversions - &lt;em>a swiss-army knife of running calculators&lt;/em>.

For each calendar, I opt to solve the puzzles in a new programming language to familiarise myself with other ways of understanding and working.
However, there comes a time in each calendar when I grow to dislike some aspect of the language.
So I had an idea&amp;hellip; why not give this whole programming language design a go?
That way, if I grow to dislike the language, I only have myself to blame!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Rubik's Cube Solver using Rust/WASM and Three.js/React</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-rubik-cube-solver-using-rust-wasm-threejs-and-react/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-rubik-cube-solver-using-rust-wasm-threejs-and-react/</guid><description>&lt;p>After building the &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-an-optimal-pocket-cube-solver-using-rust-wasm-threejs-and-react/">Pocket Cube Solver&lt;/a>, I wished to expand upon this design and cater for a conventional 3x3x3 Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube.
