<p>Recently Max Howell (creator of <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>) posted an interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768">tweet</a> in regard to Googleâ€™s interview process.
In this tweet he mentioned how one of the proposed questions was to white-board a solution to invert a binary tree.
Over the past couple of years I have been interested in exploring fundamental Computer Science data-structures and algorithms.
As a result, I thought it would be interesting to explore this structure and associated operations in more depth - using immutable and mutable PHP implementations to clearly highlight the benefits garnered from each approach.
