            <p>In a recent project, we found it beneficial to introduce the Money pattern.
There are many good <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/money.html">resources</a> on this pattern, so I will defer to those for further definition.
We decided that encapsulating this into an <a href="http://hangar.runway7.net/punditry/immutability-value-objects">immutable value object</a> allowed for a cleaner API and removed the fear of unexpected mutation bugs.
However, we noticed a spike in memory and processor usage when performing many successive actions on such values, such as summation.</p>

            <p>When a web application reaches a sufficiently large size, it can become infeasible to perform all actions required within a single web request/response lifecycle.
You may find yourself wishing to, for example, batch up and send queued emails at particular intervals or process payments asynchronously to the point in time when the user made the initial request.
In this post, I would like to discuss our evolving use of background processes (both time-dependent and continuous) due to increasing throughput demands.</p>

            <p>An interesting problem arose last week when we wished to generate a listing of recently completed jobs (along with their shortlist fees).
Upon reviewing some earlier attempts, we did not like the aesthetics present when many of a particular shortlist fee were clustered together (i.e. two or more adjacent jobs with the same shortlist fee).
What we were instead looking for was to create a constraint-based ordering that, when applied to the recently completed jobs, would give an even distribution of shortlist fees (data-set permitting).</p>

            <p>Whilst working on resolving a recent JavaScript event handler bug, it became necessary to implement a form of throttling to ensure a race condition would not occur.
Throughout the fix, I found myself seeking a clear definition of what both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">throttling</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debouncing</code> a function actually entailed, as it can be very easy to mix up these subtly different concepts.</p>

            <p>An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, whereby the height of a nodeâ€™s children differs by at most one.
In the event that this property is violated, a rebalancing process takes place.</p>
