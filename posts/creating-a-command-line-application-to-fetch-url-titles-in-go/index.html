<p>When writing show-notes for <a href="https://threedevsandamaybe.com/">Three Devs and a Maybe</a> it is tedious work to extract the associated show-link titles and generate a Markdown list from them.
This is something that I have <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/fetching-link-titles-using-promises-and-async-await-in-javascript/">documented in the past</a>, providing an automated solution to this problem.
However, in this post I would like to discuss implementing such a command-line tool using <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>, creating self-reliant executables that can be cross-compiled for Mac, Windows and Linux.
