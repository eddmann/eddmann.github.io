            <p>Github and Bitbucket are great, however, there may come a time when you wish to set up a personal Git server.
There are many reasons for this, you may legally not be permitted to host the repository externally, or you want to have more control over access privileges.
<a href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html">Gitolite</a> is here to help remedy this desire, allowing you to simply set up Git hosting on a central server with fine-grained access control capabilities.</p>

            <p>PHP has a ridiculous amount of in-built functions.
Even though I code in it daily, I am still surprised to find a new one.
It was not until recently that I discovered <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strip_tags</code>, which saved me an ample amount of time that I would have spent writing my own implementation.
My philosophy now is that if there is a function you require, PHP most likely already has it.</p>

            <p>Whilst working with PHP, I seem to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var_dump</code> a ridiculous amount.
It’s a debugging must-have.
However, it does fall short in a few ways.
It does not take into consideration that the function is almost always displayed on an HTML page, and switching to the page source can be troublesome.
Due to these pitfalls, a host of projects such as <a href="http://krumo.sourceforge.net/">Krumo</a> and <a href="http://raveren.github.io/kint/">Kint</a> have emerged to cater for these needs.
In addition to these projects, if you have <a href="http://xdebug.org/">XDebug</a> installed, it will replace the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var_dump</code> function with its own implementation that outputs the information with much-needed styling.</p>

            <p>I have been a part-time Git user for a little over a year now.
Before this, I had dabbled with using <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> but never for anything too serious.
I say ‘part-time’ because, throughout the year, I never fully got to grips with all the ideologies and tools available to support my development lifecycle process.
This was particularly evident with regard to branching.</p>

            <p>I have been a loyal <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/">MAMP Pro</a> user for many years.
I fell in love with how easy it was to set up custom hosts, without the need to tweak the hosts file myself.
However, ever since I documented my <a href="http://eddmann.com/posts/dnsmasq-your-local-development-dns/">experiences</a> with DNSMasq, I have been interested in how <a href="http://davidwinter.me/articles/2011/06/18/simple-local-web-development-with-apache-and-dnsmasq/">this</a> post documented setting up a web stack with Apache, similar to Ruby’s <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a>.
The ability to set up a new development site with only the creation of a new folder (i.e. a folder called test could be accessible at test.dev) appealed to me greatly.</p>
