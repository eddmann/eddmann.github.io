<p>When a web application reaches a sufficiently large size, it can become infeasible to perform all actions required within a single web request/response life-cycle.
You may find yourself wishing to for example - batch up and send queued emails at particular intervals, or process payments asynchronous to the point in-time the user made the initial request.
In this post I would like to discuss our changing use of background processes (both time-dependent and continuous) due to increasing throughput demands.
