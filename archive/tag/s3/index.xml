In the tradition of over-engineering a problem related to our wedding, we really did not want resized/compressed photos shared through WhatsApp/iMessage of the big day.
So instead, I decided to create a serverless photo gallery that provided guests with the ability to share the original photos in one place.
I also wanted to explore the ability to achieve this while having 100% feature parity locally in a development setting.
In this post, I would like to discuss how I went about building these photo-upload/resizing and lazy-loaded gallery capabilities using AWS Lambda, S3 and DynamoDB.
The final implementation can be found in &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-gallery" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">this GitHub repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
