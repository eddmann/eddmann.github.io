On the seventh day of Advent of Code 2016, we are required to determine which IPv7 addresses support TLS (Transport-Layer Snooping) and SSL (Super-Secret Listening).

<!--more-->

## Part 1

We are supplied with a list of IPv7 addresses, which consist of supernets (sequences outside square brackets) and hypernets (sequences within square brackets).
For part one, we are required to count how many IPv7 addresses support TLS.

> An IP supports TLS if it has an Autonomous Bridge Bypass Annotation, or ABBA.
> An ABBA is any four-character sequence which consists of a pair of two different characters followed by the reverse of that pair, such as xyyx or abba.
> However, the IP also must not have an ABBA within any hypernet sequences, which are contained by square brackets.

We will begin by parsing the IPv7 addresses into a structured form that we can process further.

```python
def parse_ips(input):
    def parse_ip(ip):
        supernets = re.split(r"\[[^\]]+\]", ip)
        hypernets = re.findall(r"\[([^\]]+)\]", ip)
        return supernets, hypernets
    return map(parse_ip, input.splitlines())
```

Now, having access to a structured tuple that includes all the supernets and hypernets for a given address, we can construct a predicate function to check if the IP supports TLS.

```python
def has_tls_support(ip):
    supernets, hypernets = ip
    abba = r"(.)((?!\1).)\2\1"
    return any(re.search(abba, s) for s in supernets) and not any(re.search(abba, h) for h in hypernets)
```

We construct a regular expression that captures an initial character (_a_), followed by a different character (_b_), and then ensures that the sequence follows the captured groupings _b_ and _a_.
This expression is then searched for within both the IP supernets and hypernets, ensuring that it is present in at least one supernet but absent from all hypernets.
With this predicate function in place, we can map over all the parsed IP addresses and count those that support TLS.
In doing so, we have answered part one of today's puzzle ðŸŒŸ.

```python
def part1(input):
    return sum(has_tls_support(ip) for ip in parse_ips(input))
```

## Part 2

For part two, we are instead asked to count how many of these parsed IPv7 addresses support SSL.

> An IP supports SSL if it has an Area-Broadcast Accessor, or ABA, anywhere in the supernet sequences (outside any square bracketed sections), and a corresponding Byte Allocation Block, or BAB, anywhere in the hypernet sequences.
> An ABA is any three-character sequence which consists of the same character twice with a different character between them, such as xyx or aba.
> A corresponding BAB is the same characters but in reversed positions: yxy and bab, respectively.

Similar to how we checked for TLS support, we will create a small predicate function that handles the base case of a single IP.

```python
def has_ssl_support(ip):
    supernets, hypernets = ip
    aba = iter(ab
               for s in supernets
               for ab in re.findall(r"(?=(.)((?!\1).)\1)", s))
    return any(b + a + b in h for a, b in aba for h in hypernets)
```

We use a regular expression again to find all occurrences of _aba_ within the provided supernets, returning the captured _a_ and _b_ values from each match.
These values are then used to check if a hypernet contains the corresponding _bab_ pattern.
We wrap the expression in a positive lookahead to accommodate overlapping matches such as `zazbz`, which contains both `zaz` and `zbz`.
This highlights the power of Python's list comprehension capabilities.

Finally, we can tweak the part one solution to filter the IP address list and count those that support SSL.
In doing so, we have answered part two of today's puzzle ðŸŒŸ.

```python
def part2(input):
    return sum(has_ssl_support(ip) for ip in parse_ips(input))
```
