    <p>Having a website that is heavily software-development based, one important aspect that can not be overlooked is well presented code examples.
Speaking on the importance of editor syntax highlighting in the <a href="http://threedevsandamaybe.com/posts/exploring-text-source-editors-and-ides/">previous episode</a> of our podcast, this attribute transcends to aid in the readability of code online.
Fortunately, there are many options to choose from.
You can either store the code snippets in an embedded <a href="http://gist.github.com/">Gists</a> or use the front-end based <a href="http://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">Google Code Prettify</a>.
One benefit that greatly simplified the publishing process when using a front-end based solution was that you could simply parse the Markdown file (perhaps with a class language type-hint) and leave all the hard work to the client’s browser.
As we all know, we have very little control over the viewing experience for each user.
And as I started to post more frequently, cracks began to appear in the syntax highlighters I had been using.
However, when looking for a solution, one had been staring me straight in the face all this time, and that was <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a>.</p>



<h2 id="enter-pygments">Enter Pygments</h2>

<p>I was first introduced to Pygments through my time using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> a couple of years ago.
Since then, however, due to limited demands in this area, I stuck with highlight.js to perform my syntax highlighting.
This had worked well until recently, when a couple of shell scripts and Java enumerated type declarations slipped it up.
If this is your first introduction to Pygments, note that it is written in Python.
While I do like the language a lot, I felt it might be overkill to move my blogging platform over to Python just for syntax highlighting (though it was not out of the question).
As a result, I decided to see if there was anything on a par in the PHP landscape.
A <a href="http://packagist.org/">Packagist</a> search returned a few hopeful results, though the output was not comparable.
I could now see why the Ruby-based Jekyll project had gone to the effort of depending on the Python-based Pygments project to handle code syntax highlighting.
Looking deeper into Pygments’ success, the questions were answered by the attention paid to supporting new languages and edge cases within the languages I was interested in.
Installation of Pygments can be simply achieved by using the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">EasyInstall</a> package manager, or on a CentOS installation via YUM.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>easy_install Pygments <span class="c"># EasyInstall</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>yum <span class="nb">install </span>python-pygments <span class="c"># CentOS</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="bridging-the-python-and-php-divide">Bridging the Python and PHP Divide</h2>

<p>Knowing now that I would only be truly happy with Pygments, my best option was to write a simple wrapper over the provided command-line interface.
This approach would be the least obtrusive to my PHP application.
Making this decision meant that I would have to handle the processing of posts’ code snippets before supplying the Markdown parser with the file’s content.
Fortunately, before updating my blog, I had decided to use the <a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/">Markdown Extra</a> parser produced by Michel Fortin.
This parser allowed me to enclose code snippets in <a href="http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#fenced-code-blocks">fenced blocks</a>.
I had also added the extra constraint of declaring these blocks with three tilde characters and a class language type-hint (~~~ .example).
This decision proved very useful when producing the example implementation below, and it can be easily expanded to cater for more code-block declarations.</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">pygments</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$post</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="nb">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$pipes</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]);</span>

        <span class="nv">$output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">stream_get_contents</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$pipes</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]);</span>
        <span class="nb">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$pipes</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]);</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">proc_close</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$proc</span><span class="p">))</span>

    <span class="p">},</span> <span class="nv">$post</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Coupled with the decision to only handle a defined code-block definition, I also made the assumption that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygmentize</code> command is present in the user’s path.
This can be easily altered if necessary.
Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proc_open</code> function supplied by PHP, I was able to begin a child process which used the defined STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR descriptor pipes that I supplied.
I decided to omit the STDERR pipe as I could detect an error occurring (regardless of the exact reason) when closing the process using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proc_close</code>.
In the case of an error (a non-zero returned value), I would simply return the original content for the Markdown parser to process accordingly.
Within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygmentize</code> command, I supplied the option for HTML and default-styling/UTF-8 output.
The ‘startinline’ option removes the requirement to define a PHP start tag when displaying PHP syntax-highlighted code blocks.
The ‘default’ styling was intentionally defined to provide easier setup, as discussed in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="simple-styling">Simple Styling</h2>

<p>There are many styling and output options present in Pygments.
I would strongly recommend you check out the documentation.
Custom styles are typically installed in the same manner as the library itself, using EasyInstall.
However, there are many built-in styles which rely on the output generated from the ‘default’ style option.
My favourite is <a href="http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/">Zenburn</a>.
These stylesheets can be generated using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygmentize</code> command itself.
But to make it super simple, <a href="http://github.com/richleland/pygments-css">this</a> GitHub repository provides them preprocessed.
If you have not already got a style in mind, you can check out <a href="http://igniteflow.com/pygments/themes/">this</a> page which neatly displays examples of each of the available styles.</p>
