This one&amp;rsquo;s been heavy on building - a coding agent harness, a labour contraction timer, a desktop diff reviewer - but also on reflecting on how I&amp;rsquo;m actually using these tools and what patterns are emerging.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bridging the Gap Between iOS Native Functionality and JavaScript Web Applications</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/bridging-the-gap-between-ios-native-functionality-and-javascript-web-applications/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/bridging-the-gap-between-ios-native-functionality-and-javascript-web-applications/</guid><description>In this post, I share a pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve been using to bridge native iOS functionality with JavaScript running inside a WKWebView.

After my recent exploration into &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/">PWAs&lt;/a> this past year, I wanted a reason to explore Kotlin and Swift, two languages equipped for native mobile (Android and iOS) development.
Before delving into the mobile domain, I wanted to see what each language had to offer.
In this post, I will document my experience completing the Advent of Code 2023 calendar in both &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/kotlin" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Kotlin&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023/swift" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Swift&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a Contact Tracing Scanner using Swift for macOS</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/creating-a-contact-tracing-scanner-using-swift-for-macos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/creating-a-contact-tracing-scanner-using-swift-for-macos/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following on from my &lt;a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/creating-a-contact-tracing-scanner-using-web-bluetooth/">previous experiment&lt;/a> which highlighted what an Exposure Notification-enabled device actually emits using Web Bluetooth, I decided to explore how I could do the same using Swift and Interface Builder for macOS.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
