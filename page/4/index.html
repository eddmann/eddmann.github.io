            <p>Whilst <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-infra#stage-applications">documenting</a> how I structured the <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-infra">infrastructure</a> used for hosting our wedding website, I mentioned the possibility of showcasing its use for another application concern.
In the tradition of over-engineering a problem related to our wedding, we really did not want resized/compressed photos shared through WhatsApp/iMessage of the big day.
So instead, I decided to create a serverless photo gallery that provided guests with the ability to share the original photos in one place.
I also wanted to explore the ability to achieve this while having 100% feature parity locally in a development setting.
In this post, I would like to discuss how I went about building these photo-upload/resizing and lazy-loaded gallery capabilities using AWS Lambda, S3 and DynamoDB.
The final implementation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-gallery">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

            <p>Over the past year or so, I have been interested in microcontrollers and finding ways I can look to <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-2fa-totp-generator-using-a-raspberry-pi-pico-and-micropython/">use them</a> within personal projects.
Having just completed the <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/solving-the-advent-of-code-2021-calendar-using-c-in-under-half-a-second/">Advent of Code 2021</a> calendar in C, I thought it would be interesting to see how many of these solutions I could get to run on the constrained hardware of a Raspberry Pi Pico.
In this article, I will discuss how I went about achieving this, presenting the solutions’ answers on a <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack?variant=32368664215635">Pimoroni Display</a> via an interactive menu (with paging).</p>

            <p>Since being introduced to the world of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> just prior to the 2020 calendar starting, I subsequently spent the majority of 2021 completing (and documenting) the <a href="https://eddmann.com/archive/tag/advent-of-code-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="https://eddmann.com/archive/tag/advent-of-code-2016/">2016</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017/rust">2017</a> calendars.
For the 2021 calendar, I decided that it would be interesting (and challenging) to complete the calendar in C, with an initial solution written in Python to meet the daily aspect of the challenge.
Additionally, with C being such a performant language, I also wanted to set the goal of ensuring that the entire C calendar was solvable on a single CPU core in under half a second (inspired by <a href="https://www.dannyvankooten.com/blog/2021/solving-advent-of-code-2020-under-1-second/">this</a> blog post).
In this post, I wish to discuss how I went about achieving this goal (<em>spoiler</em>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">410315 μs (0.410 s)</code> on average) and the hurdles I faced along the way.</p>

            <p>Over the past couple of weeks, I have been considering how feasible it would be to deploy the <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-website">wedding website</a> I released earlier this year on Kubernetes using a Raspberry Pi cluster.
After a little research, this past bank holiday weekend, I set myself the goal of building and deploying the web application on Kubernetes by the end of the Monday bank holiday!
In this post, I would like to discuss how I went about achieving this goal and what I learnt in the process.</p>

            <p>We have been big fans of DataDog and the level of telemetry/monitoring it provides us for many years now.
One such aspect of monitoring that we employ throughout the services we maintain is <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/http_check/">HTTP health checks</a>, which are intentionally run on a separate cloud provider to our primary, which is AWS.
DataDog has provided the ability to handle running these checks via <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/">their agent</a> for many years, offering us a sufficient black-box means of ensuring a service is functioning as expected.
This past week, we explored the viability of containerising this responsibility into a service that could be run on a serverless platform such as the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform">DigitalOcean App Platform</a>.</p>
