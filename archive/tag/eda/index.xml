It covers how events propagate between subdomains, the trade-offs between choreography and orchestration, and how to handle idempotency, observability, and event schema design. Inspired by a real-world example in Monolith to Microservices, the post also includes infrastructure-as-code examples using both CloudFormation and Terraform.</description></item></channel></rss>
