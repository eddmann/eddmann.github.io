<p>Throughout project development we use Jenkins to provide meaningful test feedback on each Git push event.
These builds are required for a sufficient amount of confidence to be gained for merging into <em>master</em> and subsequently deployment.

However, typically we find ourselves working on multiple branches throughout the day, and it can become cumbersome to update the projects configuration.
