As we all know, we have very little control over the viewing experience for each user.
And as I started to post more frequently, cracks began to appear in the syntax highlighters I had been using.
However, when looking for a solution, one had been staring me straight in the face all this time, and that was <a href=http://pygments.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Pygments</a>.</p><h2 id=enter-pygments>Enter Pygments</h2><p>I was first introduced to Pygments through my time using <a href=http://jekyllrb.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Jekyll</a> a couple of years ago.
Since then, however, due to limited demands in this area, I stuck with highlight.js to perform my syntax highlighting.
This had worked well until recently, when a couple of shell scripts and Java enumerated type declarations slipped it up.
If this is your first introduction to Pygments, note that it is written in Python.
While I do like the language a lot, I felt it might be overkill to move my blogging platform over to Python just for syntax highlighting (though it was not out of the question).
As a result, I decided to see if there was anything on a par in the PHP landscape.
A <a href=http://packagist.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Packagist</a> search returned a few hopeful results, though the output was not comparable.
I could now see why the Ruby-based Jekyll project had gone to the effort of depending on the Python-based Pygments project to handle code syntax highlighting.
Looking deeper into Pygments&rsquo; success, the questions were answered by the attention paid to supporting new languages and edge cases within the languages I was interested in.
Installation of Pygments can be simply achieved by using the <a href=http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools rel="external noopener" target=_blank>EasyInstall</a> package manager, or on a CentOS installation via YUM.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>$ sudo easy_install Pygments <span style=color:#75715e># EasyInstall</span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>$ sudo yum install python-pygments <span style=color:#75715e># CentOS</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id=bridging-the-python-and-php-divide>Bridging the Python and PHP Divide</h2><p>Knowing now that I would only be truly happy with Pygments, my best option was to write a simple wrapper over the provided command-line interface.
This approach would be the least obtrusive to my PHP application.
Making this decision meant that I would have to handle the processing of posts&rsquo; code snippets before supplying the Markdown parser with the file&rsquo;s content.
Fortunately, before updating my blog, I had decided to use the <a href=http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Markdown Extra</a> parser produced by Michel Fortin.
This parser allowed me to enclose code snippets in <a href=http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#fenced-code-blocks rel="external noopener" target=_blank>fenced blocks</a>.
I had also added the extra constraint of declaring these blocks with three tilde characters and a class language type-hint (~~~ .example).
This decision proved very useful when producing the example implementation below, and it can be easily expanded to cater for more code-block declarations.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-php data-lang=php><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>function</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>pygments</span>($post)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Coupled with the decision to only handle a defined code-block definition, I also made the assumption that the <code>pygmentize</code> command is present in the user&rsquo;s path.
This can be easily altered if necessary.
Using the <code>proc_open</code> function supplied by PHP, I was able to begin a child process which used the defined STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR descriptor pipes that I supplied.
I decided to omit the STDERR pipe as I could detect an error occurring (regardless of the exact reason) when closing the process using <code>proc_close</code>.
In the case of an error (a non-zero returned value), I would simply return the original content for the Markdown parser to process accordingly.
Within the <code>pygmentize</code> command, I supplied the option for HTML and default-styling/UTF-8 output.
The &lsquo;startinline&rsquo; option removes the requirement to define a PHP start tag when displaying PHP syntax-highlighted code blocks.
The &lsquo;default&rsquo; styling was intentionally defined to provide easier setup, as discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id=simple-styling>Simple Styling</h2><p>There are many styling and output options present in Pygments.
I would strongly recommend you check out the documentation.
Custom styles are typically installed in the same manner as the library itself, using EasyInstall.
However, there are many built-in styles which rely on the output generated from the &lsquo;default&rsquo; style option.
My favourite is <a href=http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Zenburn</a>.
These stylesheets can be generated using the <code>pygmentize</code> command itself.
But to make it super simple, <a href=http://github.com/richleland/pygments-css rel="external noopener" target=_blank>this</a> GitHub repository provides them preprocessed.
If you have not already got a style in mind, you can check out <a href=http://igniteflow.com/pygments/themes/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>this</a> page which neatly displays examples of each of the available styles.</p><h2 id=resources>Resources</h2><ul><li><a href=http://highlightjs.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>highlight.js</a></li><li><a href=http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Google Code Prettify</a></li><li><a href=http://pygments.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Pygments</a></li><li><a href=http://packagist.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Packagist</a></li><li><a href=http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Markdown Extra</a></li><li><a href=http://www.sitepoint.com/proc-open-communicate-with-the-outside-world/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Proc_Open: Communicate with the Outside World</a></li><li><a href=http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.proc-open.php rel="external noopener" target=_blank>PHP Documentation: proc_open</a></li><li><a href=http://github.com/richleland/pygments-css rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Pygments CSS Styles</a></li><li><a href=http://igniteflow.com/pygments/themes/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Pygments Style Previews</a></li></ul></main><footer class=post-footer><ul class="tags tags--large"><li><a href=/archive/tag/pygments>pygments</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/php>php</a></li></ul><div class=related><h3 class=related__title>Related Posts</h3><ul class=related__posts><li><a href=/posts/using-partial-application-in-php/>Using Partial Application in PHP</a></li><li><a href=/posts/simple-function-driven-development/>Simple Function Driven-Development</a></li><li><a href=/posts/installing-nginx-apache-mysql-php-5-5-lamp-stack-on-cent-os-6-4/>Installing Nginx/Apache, MySQL, PHP 5.5 (LAMP) stack on CentOS 6.4</a></li><li><a href=/posts/coalescing-operation-in-php/>Coalescing Operation in PHP (for Default Values)</a></li><li><a href=/posts/accessing-php-documentation-using-pman/>Accessing PHP documentation using 'pman'</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer l-wrapper"><div>&copy; 2025, Edd Mann</div><button class=site-footer__theme-toggle type=button title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg fill="currentcolor" viewBox="0 0 32 32" role="img"><title>Theme toggle icon</title><desc>A circle representing the moon for toggling theme</desc><path d="M16 .5C7.4.5.5 7.4.5 16S7.4 31.5 16 31.5 31.5 24.6 31.5 16 24.6.5 16 .5zm0 28.1V3.4C23 3.4 28.6 9 28.6 16S23 28.6 16 28.6z"/></svg></button></footer></body></html>
