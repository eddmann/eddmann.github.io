            <p>Heapsort is a sorting algorithm which can be split into two distinct stages.
The first stage is to build a tree-based heap data structure from the supplied input.
Conforming to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap">heap property</a> either requires the structure follow that all parent nodes are greater than or equal to their children (with the highest at the root), or the inverse.</p>

            <p>After experimenting with the <a href="/posts/experimenting-with-the-xor-swap-method-in-java/">XOR swap method in Java</a> I had hoped to follow it up with exploration of the XOR double linked-list.
Java objects however, are not directly accessible through pointer reference.
This is by no means a limitation, allowing the Garbage collector to efficiently and safely handle memory allocation.
Sometimes it is desired to have such access however, and you can take advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface">JNI</a> to call assembly, or C/C++ code from within Java.
Another option is to use the <a href="http://mishadoff.github.io/blog/java-magic-part-4-sun-dot-misc-dot-unsafe/">sun.misc.Unsafe</a> class, providing many ‘unsafe’ operations, one of which is to retrieve object memory address locations.</p>

            <p>Following on from the discussion on implementing a <a href="/posts/implementing-a-singly-linked-list-in-c/">singly linked-list</a> in C, a logical follow-up data-structure is the doubly linked-list.
In a similar fashion, the structure is composed from a set of sequentially linked nodes, each now containing references (pointers) to not only the next node but the previous one to.
This structure is useful if the use-case dictates the desire to traverse the list both forwards and backwards, or quickly determine preceding and following elements from a given node.
The head and tail nodes can be terminated with either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_node">sentinel nodes</a> (referred to as ‘circularly linked’ if only one is used) or like in the implementation shown below, NULL.
An observational implementation difference between the two structures is that through storing the previous and next reference, it can significantly simplify the complexity and running time of certain operations (removal from the tail being the most obvious).</p>

            <p>Over the past couple of days I have become very interested in brushing up on my limited C knowledge.
As I discussed in my previous <a href="/posts/experimenting-with-the-xor-swap-method-in-java/">post</a> on using the XOR swap method, everyday languages are becoming very high-level, and as a result taking away some of the fun.
In the next couple of posts I wish to implement some of the common place data-structures found in development, but unlike previous attempts, these will be in straight C.</p>

            <p>The Exclusive disjunction (or) swap algorithm is a little trick to swap values of equal data type without the use of a temporary variable.
Typically, low-level data types like integers are used in practice, but in theory any value represented by fixed-length <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">bit-strings</a> will work.
Though bad practice in most use-cases, it does help to highlight implementation details which can seem foreign to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">higher-level</a> programmers.
Due to the strong levels of abstraction put in place to help aid development of complicated systems we sometimes lose the beautify in working with the underlying bits and bytes.
An example of such an abstraction is the <a href="http://javabook.compuware.com/content/memory/how-garbage-collection-works.aspx">garbage collector</a> found in the JVM, which takes care of memory management concerns which in other lower-level languages would be of huge consideration.</p>
