In the very first screencast episode of [Three Devs and a Maybe](https://threedevsandamaybe.com/), I was fortunate to chat with PHP core developer [Joe Watkins](http://blog.krakjoe.ninja/), discussing PHP 5 and 7 extension development for beginners.
Starting off by checking out the latest PHP source code from GitHub, we move on to installing the required development environment from scratch within Linux.
We then compile a basic CLI version of PHP for development purposes, verifying the installation using the provided tests.
Finally, we wrap up the show by creating a simple `array_sum` PHP extension clone using the provided `ext_skel`.
This example highlights the use of macros and common array-based actions that take place in a typical extension.
