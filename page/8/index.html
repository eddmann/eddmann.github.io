            <p>On the third day of Advent of Code 2015 we are asked to help determine (based on supplied directions) how many houses Santa (and Robo-Santa) will deliver presents to.</p>

            <p>The second day of Advent of Code 2015 brings us a small Math problem by-way of Elves <em>running-low</em> on wrapping paper.
With the Present dimensions (perfect right rectangular prisms) provided we are answer several related questions.</p>

            <p>This past Decemeber a <a href="https://github.com/tomcant">fellow colleague</a> introduced us to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.
What initially started out as completing each daily 2020 puzzle <em>in my own time</em> soon turned into a daily obession, and in-turn an incredible learning experience shared amongst the team.</p>

<p>Having completed the 2020 calendar at the end of last year, over the past couple of weeks we have began working through the previous calendars.
Over the coming months I hope to record each of my solutions, with the goal of completing all the previous puzzles just-in-time for the 2021 calendar to commence.</p>

            <p>Following on from my previous post which highlighted my experience building an <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-an-enigma-machine-in-clojurescript/">Enigma Machine in ClojureScript</a>, I decided it would be interesting to model the machine within Haskell.
I felt solving the same problem in this mannor would be a great way to compare and contrast Lisp and heavily-typed languages such as Haskell.
Through this process I also wanted to explore using Hspec and QuickCheck for comparable Property-based testing that I achieved in the ClojureScript counterpart.</p>

            <p>The Enigma Machine is a typewriter-sized substitution encryption device used by Germany in World War 2.
It was so important to the war-time efforts that work carried out by Alan Turing at Bletchley Park to decode the resulting ciphers helped end the war.
For years I have been fascinated by this device, and thought it would be interesting to explore implementing a web-based Enigma Machine using ClojureScript.
I also thought it would be a great opportunity to explore how I can use Property-based testing to help garner confidence from the resulting implementation.</p>
