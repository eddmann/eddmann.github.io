            <p>Over the <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/allocating-and-notifying-secret-santas-via-email-using-clojure/">past</a> <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-secret-santa-allocator-and-sms-sender-using-a-raspberry-pi-pico-micropython-and-sim800l-module/">several</a> <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/allocating-secret-santas-using-an-aws-step-function-workflow-and-every-available-lambda-runtime/">years</a> I have taken the opportunity of allocating Secret Santa’s for members of my family as a means of exploring new technologies.
For the past several months I have been interested in the concept of Progress Web Application’s (thanks in large part to <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pwas/">this series</a>), and getting more hands-on experience in with the ever-changing frontend landscape.
As such, I decided that this year I would build a small application that works across Desktop, iOS and Android to perform Secret Santa draws in both a local and remote setting.
In this article I would like to document how I went about building this application.</p>

            <p>I have been an avid runner for many years now, but I still get confused by imperial and metric measurements.
On top of this, the amount of times I seek out a random website to perform some form of pace/distance calculation is too often to count.
What I wanted was a desktop and mobile application that could perform pace, distance and time calculations, along with imperial/metric conversions - <em>a swiss-army knife of running calculators</em>.
In this article I would like to document my experience building a <a href="https://web.dev/articles/what-are-pwas">Progress Web Application</a> (PWA) which does just this; providing a native app-like experience across iOS, Android and Desktop.</p>

            <p>December has come and gone, and the dust has settled on completing the Advent of Code 2022 calendar.
As highlighted in my <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/designing-santa-lang-a-language-for-solving-advent-of-code-puzzles/">previous post</a>, I wanted to complete this year’s puzzles using my own programming language, santa-lang, which I have tailored to help aid in solving such problems.
In this article I want to discuss this experience, how the language aided in solution development, and where additions/changes were made to improve it along the way.</p>

            <p>Over the past several years I have been slowly working <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2015">my</a> <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2016/python">way</a> <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017/rust">through</a> the previous Advent of Code calendars.
For each calendar I opt to solve the puzzles in a new programming language, to familiarise myself with other ways of understanding and working.
However, there comes a time in each calendar that I grow to dislike some aspect of the language.
So I had an idea… why not give this whole programming language design a go.
That way if I grow to dislike the language, I only have myself to blame!</p>

            <p>Over the past several years I have taken the opportunity of allocating Secret Santa’s for members of my family as an excuse to explore different <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/allocating-and-notifying-secret-santas-via-email-using-clojure/">programming languages</a> and <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-secret-santa-allocator-and-sms-sender-using-a-raspberry-pi-pico-micropython-and-sim800l-module/">technologies</a>.
This year has been no different, with me opting to <em>over-engineer</em> the problem of allocating and notifying participants by diving into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">AWS Step Functions</a> and the many runtimes available on Lambda.
In this post I wish to document how I went about designing the Step Function workflow, and breaking up the problem into many specific-purpose Lambda behaviours.
The final implementation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/step-function-secret-santa">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
