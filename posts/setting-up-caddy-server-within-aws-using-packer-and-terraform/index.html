<p>With the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html">recent update</a> to Google Chrome helping shape a more secure Web by marking all HTTP sites as “not secure”, I thought it was time that I make the necessary changes to how we host audio files for the <a href="https://threedevsandamaybe.com/">Three Devs and a Maybe</a> podcast.
In this post I would like to discuss setting up <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy Server</a> (which provides HTTPS out of the box!) as a static-hosting platform on AWS - provisioning the instance with Packer and the surrounding infrastructure using Terraform.
