            <p>I have been using Git for the past couple of years and remember how long it took me to get my head around the work-flow.
Throughout the past couple of months, thanks to a couple of <a href="http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf">well</a> <a href="http://mrchlblng.me/2014/09/practical-git-introduction/">timed</a> <a href="http://episodes.gitminutes.com/">findings</a>, I have gained an interest into how Git works internally.
In this post I hope to explain how Git uses well-designed, composed low-level commands to create the high-level actions we are familiar with using on a day-to-day basis.</p>

            <p>Last week I was bit by the Unicode encoding issue when trying to naively manipulate a user’s input using PHP’s built-in string functions.
PHP simply assumes that all characters are a single byte (octet) and the provided functions use this assumption when processing a string.
In this article I will not be going into depth on the subject of Unicode representations, I feel this topic deserves it’s own series of articles.
However, you should be aware that in ‘Western Europe’ we commonly only use the basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> character-set (consisting of 7 bytes).
This makes the transition to the popular ‘UTF-8’ Unicode representation almost seamless, as the two map one-to-one.
I wish to however, discuss how to reverse a Unicode string (UTF-8) using a combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianness</a> magic and the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strrev.php">‘strrev’</a> function.</p>

            <p>Since recently setting up a forum for <a href="http://forum.threedevsandamaybe.com/">Three Devs and a Maybe</a>, we have started to partake in a weekly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)">code-kata</a>.
What could be more fitting to start with than the common interview question, reversing a string in ‘X’ language.
In this case the language is PHP, and below are some of the many ways contrived to solve the problem.</p>

            <p>Since exploring languages such as Scala and Python which provide the tuple data-structure, I have been keen to experiment with how to clearly map it into a PHP solution.
Tuples are simply a finite, ordered sequence of elements - usually with good language support to both pack (construction) and unpack (deconstruction) of the values.
I have found that many use-cases of the common place array structure in PHP could be better suited to n-tuple’s.
Familiar examples such as coordinate pairs (points) and records from a relational database (i.e. maybe the user id and name) could succinctly take advantage of the structure.</p>

            <p>Yesterday I was looking through some application logs and noticed a significant bottleneck with I/O reads in the implemented file cache.
This cache is used to temporary store processed views and records for a set duration.
I looked into a couple of solutions to alleviate the intense spinning disk usage, ranging from <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcache</a> to <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>.
These products are great for large-scale applications (spread over multiple systems), however, in my case simply required a single local configuration.</p>
