Below, I will discuss the different areas I needed to consider, which led to the final result shown above.</p><h2 id=appification>App&rsquo;ification</h2><p><video style=width:100% preload=metadata controls muted>

<source src=/posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/android-install.mp4 type=video/mp4>Your browser does not support the video element.</video></p><h3 id=look-and-feel>Look and Feel</h3><p>A large area of research and development was making the user experience <em>look and feel</em> like a native application typically found on both mobile and desktop devices.
A lot of time was spent essentially <em>&lsquo;de-webifying&rsquo;</em> the web application to align with user expectations of a native app experience.
This included disabling page zooming capabilities, user text selection, and document overflow scrolling.
These were all fortunately achievable using CSS, with a small dose of browser-specific prefixes (Safari&mldr;).
I did, however, have to resort to some JavaScript to disable touch body scroll when the soft keyboard appears on mobile for focused input fields.
Although this process required trial and error, the learnings garnered can be applied going forward to other app-like web experiences and PWAs I wish to develop.</p><h3 id=mobile>Mobile</h3><p>When the iPhone was initially released, Steve Jobs touted an innovative new way to create web applications <em>&ldquo;that look exactly and behave exactly like native apps&rdquo;</em> during the launch&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlE7dzoD6GA" rel="external noopener" target=_blank>one more thing</a> section.
However, the momentum soon dwindled with the release of a native SDK several months later - and the subsequent popularity and revenue of the App Store have not made Apple regret that decision.
This has led to much of my PWA development experience feeling like a constant struggle to make things work on iOS&mldr; (and this is coming from an Apple fanboy).
iOS is still <a href=https://firt.dev/notes/pwa-ios/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>way behind</a> the fantastic web capability support present on Android.
For instance, it has only recently added <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Web Push</a> capabilities since iOS 16.4.</p><p>Below are several key pain points I encountered while developing this PWA on iOS.</p><h4 id=splash-screens>Splash Screens</h4><p>The number of splash screen assets required for full iOS device support is mind-blowing.
Not only do you need to supply numerous assets upfront, but iOS also requires custom Safari-specific meta-tag workarounds to register different splash screen variants.
This is in stark contrast to Android, where the system can use an existing icon provided by the Web App Manifest.</p><h4 id=orientation>Orientation</h4><p>iOS lacks support for the Web App Manifest <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/orientation rel="external noopener" target=_blank>orientation</a> property, which allows you to specify whether the PWA supports portrait and/or landscape modes.
Instead, you must cater for both orientations or display crude CSS-based &lsquo;Not supported in this orientation&rsquo; messages to the user.</p><h4 id=installation-prompt>Installation Prompt</h4><p>Most annoyingly, iOS lacks native <a href=https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation-prompt rel="external noopener" target=_blank>installation prompts</a>, whereas Android and Chrome desktop devices fully support them.
It does not support the <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event, meaning that to install a PWA, users must manually visit Safari, open the bottom menu bar, and select &lsquo;Add to Home Screen&rsquo; 🤦.
Third-party browsers (e.g. Chrome), although required to use the Safari web engine, do not support installing PWAs.
This severely hinders PWA adoption compared to the seamless experience iOS provides for App Store installations.
Android, on the other hand, offers a great user experience, leveraging screenshots found in the Web App Manifest to aid installation.
It even packages the application as a <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Trusted Web Activity</a>, treating the PWA as a standard Android application rather than a mere Safari <em>bookmark</em>.
You can see how the two experiences differ by watching the videos above.</p><h3 id=desktop>Desktop</h3><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/desktop-wide-pace_hu_cbb0bc193e02b9f9.webp 350w, /posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/desktop-wide-pace_hu_981eb69ef105f0fe.webp 700w, /posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/desktop-wide-pace_hu_21574f0f52157942.webp 1400w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/desktop-wide-pace_hu_5f2018e6e2b19a3b.jpg 350w, /posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/desktop-wide-pace_hu_ddf93313838cea1c.jpg 700w, /posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/desktop-wide-pace_hu_70297cc4ebbb748.jpg 1400w"><img src=/posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/desktop-wide-pace_hu_ddf93313838cea1c.jpg alt="Desktop (wide)" loading=lazy>

Since PWAs are only supported in Google Chrome (and variants such as Microsoft Edge), the scope of browsers that needed catering was limited.
What is great about this approach is that there is no need to wrap your application in an <a href=https://www.electronjs.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Electron</a>/<a href=https://tauri.app/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Tauri</a> wrapper if the APIs supplied by Google Chrome meet your needs.</p><video style=width:100% preload=metadata controls muted>

Although the application itself is simple, it has allowed me to explore many fundamental aspects of PWA development that need to considered when building web applications that should look and feel native.
iOS support, although lacking behind Android considerably, at least provides a native look and feel once it has been installed on to the device.
Going forward, I would like to explore how I can use projects such as <a href=https://www.pwabuilder.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>PWABuilder</a> to package the PWA for submission to the Google Play and Apple App Store, helping to address some of the discussed shortcomings.</p></main><footer class=post__tags><a href=/archive/tag/pwa>pwa</a><a href=/archive/tag/react>react</a><a href=/archive/tag/typescript>typescript</a></footer></article><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer wrapper"><div>&copy; 2025, Edd Mann</div></footer><script>(function(){document.querySelector(".site-header__mobile-navigation-button").addEventListener("click",e=>{document.documentElement.classList.toggle("mobile-navigation-open"),e.target.setAttribute("aria-expanded",e.target.getAttribute("aria-expanded")==="false"?"true":"false")});const n=document.querySelector(".site-header");let t=window.pageYOffset,e=!1;window.addEventListener("scroll",()=>{if(e)return;setTimeout(()=>{const s=window.pageYOffset;n.classList.toggle("is-sticky",s>0&&t>s),t=s,e=!1},500),e=!0})})()</script></body></html>
