Recently Max Howell (creator of [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)) posted an interesting [tweet](https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768) in regard to Google's interview process.
In this tweet he mentioned how one of the proposed questions was to white-board a solution to invert a binary tree.
Over the past couple of years I have been interested in exploring fundamental Computer Science data-structures and algorithms.
As a result, I thought it would be interesting to explore this structure and associated operations in more depth - using immutable and mutable PHP implementations to clearly highlight the benefits garnered from each approach.
