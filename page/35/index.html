            <p>Since recently setting up a forum for <a href="http://forum.threedevsandamaybe.com/">Three Devs and a Maybe</a>, we have started to partake in a weekly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)">code-kata</a>.
What could be more fitting to start with than the common interview question, reversing a string in a given language.
In this case the language is PHP, and below are some of the many ways contrived to solve the problem.</p>

            <p>Since exploring languages such as Scala and Python which provide the tuple data structure, I have been keen to experiment with how to clearly map it into a PHP solution.
Tuples are simply a finite, ordered sequence of elements - usually with good language support to both pack (construction) and unpack (deconstruction) the values.
I have found that many use cases of the commonplace array structure in PHP could be better suited to n-tuples.
Familiar examples such as coordinate pairs (points) and records from a relational database (e.g. a user id and name) could succinctly take advantage of the structure.</p>

            <p>Yesterday I was looking through some application logs and noticed a significant bottleneck with I/O reads in the implemented file cache.
This cache is used to temporarily store processed views and records for a set duration.
I looked into a couple of solutions to alleviate the intense spinning disk usage, ranging from <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcache</a> to <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>.
These products are great for large-scale applications spread over multiple systems.
However, in my case, a single local configuration was sufficient.</p>

            <p>The Caesar cipher (shift cipher) is an extremely simple encryption technique.
Substitutions of this kind rely on an invariant - replacing each plain-text letter with the letter at a fixed number of positions across the alphabet.
The recipient is then able to decode the encoded message successfully if they are aware of the chosen shift.</p>

            <p>Following on from my previous post on <a href="/posts/self-signed-ssl-certificates-with-nginx-and-apache/">Self-signed SSL certificates</a>, I would now like to address the second most common Web application vulnerability (<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management">Broken Authentication and Session Management</a>).
When delving into the subject I was unable to find a definitive resource for a PHP implementation.
Due to this, I set out to combine all the best practice I could find into a single session handler, to help protect against the common attack vectors.
Since PHP 5.4, you are able to set the session handler based on a class instance that extends the default <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SessionHandler</code> class.</p>
