meta: "Abstracting asynchronous error-first callbacks found in Node into a Promise"
---

I have been writing a lot about Promises in JavaScript the past couple of weeks.
What happens however, when you wish to use an asynchronous function which does not return a Promise, such as those found in Node?
It is actually pretty simple to abstract away the error-first asynchronous function callback into a Promise we can handle.
<!--more-->

{% highlight js %}
const promisify = (fn) => (...args) =>
  new Promise((res, rej) =>
    fn(...args, (err, val) => err ? rej(err) : res(val)));
{% endhighlight %}

We are now able to wrap a function which uses the error-first callback paradigm into a Promise, as demoed below.

{% highlight js %}
promisify(fs.readFile)('./hello.txt', 'utf8')
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
// Hello, world!
{% endhighlight %}
