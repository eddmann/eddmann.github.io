            <p>Github and Bitbucket are great, however, there may come a time when you wish to setup a personal Git server.
There are many reason for this, you may legally not be permitted to host the repository externally, or you want to have more control over access privileges.
<a href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html">Gitolite</a> is here to help remedy this desire, allowing you to simply setup Git hosting on a central server with fine-grained access control capabilities.</p>

            <p>PHP has a ridiculous amout of in-built functions, even though I code in it daily I still get the surprise of finding a new one.
It was not until recently that I touched upon ‘strip_tags’, saving me amples amount of time having to write my own implementation.
My philosophy now is that if theres a function need you require, PHP most likely already has it.</p>

            <p>Whilst working with PHP, I seem to use ‘var_dump’ a ridiculous amount, its a debugging must-have.
However, it does fall short in a few ways, especially in how it does not take into consideration that the function is almost always displayed in a HTML page - switching to the page’s source can become a pain.
Due to the pitfalls a host of projects such as <a href="http://krumo.sourceforge.net/">Krumo</a> and <a href="http://raveren.github.io/kint/">Kint</a> have cropped up to cater for these needs.
As well as these projects, if you have <a href="http://xdebug.org/">XDebug</a> installed it will replace the default ‘var_dump’ function with its own implementation that outputs the information with well-needed styling.</p>

            <p>I have been a part-time Git user for alittle over a year now, before this I had dabbled with using <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> but never for anything too serious.
I say part-time as throughout the year I never fully got to grips with all the ideologies/tools provided to aid in my development lifecyle process - in particular branching.</p>

            <p>I have been a loyal <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/">MAMP Pro</a> user for many years, I fell in love with how easy it was to setup custom hosts, without the need to tweak the hosts file myself.
However, ever since I documented my <a href="http://eddmann.com/posts/dnsmasq-your-local-development-dns/">experiences</a> with DNSMasq I have been intrested in how <a href="http://davidwinter.me/articles/2011/06/18/simple-local-web-development-with-apache-and-dnsmasq/">this</a> article documented setting up a web-stack with Apache similar to Ruby user’s <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a>.
The ability to setup a new development site with only the creation of a new folder (i.e. a folder called test could be accessible from test.dev) appealed to me greatly.</p>
