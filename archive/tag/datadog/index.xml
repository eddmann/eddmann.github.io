One such aspect of monitoring that we employ throughout the services we maintain is &lt;a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/http_check/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">HTTP health checks&lt;/a>, which are intentionally run on a separate cloud provider to our primary, which is AWS.
DataDog has provided the ability to handle running these checks via &lt;a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">their agent&lt;/a> for many years, offering us a sufficient black-box means of ensuring a service is functioning as expected.
