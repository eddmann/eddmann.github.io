            <p>Over the past couple of weeks I have been thinking of how feasible it would be to deploy the <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-website">wedding website</a> I released earlier this year on Kubernetes using a Raspberry Pi cluster.
After a little research, this past bank-holiday weekend I set myself the goal to build and deploy the web application on Kubernetes by the end of the Monday bank-holiday!
In this post I would like to discuss how I went about achieving this goal and what I learnt in the process.</p>

            <p>We have been a big fan of DataDog and the level of telemetry/monitoring it provides us for many years now.
One such aspect of monitoring that we employ throughout the services we maintain are <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/http_check/">HTTP health checks</a>, which are intentionally run on a separate cloud provider to our primary which is AWS.
DataDog has supplied the ability to handle running these checks via <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/">their agent</a> for many years, providing us with a sufficient blackbox means of ensuring a service is functioning as expected.
This past week we explored the viability of containerising this responsibility into a service which could be run on a Serverless platform such as the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform">DigitalOcean App Platform</a>.</p>

            <p>I have always been amazed by the sheer amount of services AWS offers.
Although I spend a lot of time working within AWS, I am always surprised to find yet another service that I did not know existed.
Better still, is with each new service comes an associated new service icon.
This is why I thought it would be interesting (and somewhat educational) to build a small trivia game which quizzes you on AWS service icons.</p>

            <p>I am a big proponent of the Serverless movement.
The ability to concentrate efforts on only the code and infrastructure concerns which directly add business value is very powerful.
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offerings like AWS Lambda impose limitations which help aid in designing more fault tolerant/scalable systems; leaning towards event-driven architectures.
However, there are times when we need to execute behaviour which exceed common-place FaaS duration limits (i.e. AWS Lambdaâ€™s 15-minute limit).
In this case we ideally do not want to resort to a lower-level of compute (i.e. a VPS such as EC2), but instead be able to define and run such behaviour alongside our FaaS counterparts.
In this post I would like to discuss a <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/serverless-fargate">Serverless Framework plugin</a> I have written which aids in bridging this gap, by-way of ECS and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a>.</p>

            <p>Having had great success using AWS Lambda within our insurance product (<a href="https://mybuilder-plus.com/">MyBuilder Plus</a>), late last year we made the decision to move <strong>all</strong> our web request traffic over to the platform!
However, we noticed when attempting to migrate over one application in particular, that we could not use the latest release of <a href="https://bref.sh/">Bref</a> (the PHP runtime) due to a conflict between required Symfony <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html">Process component</a> versions.</p>
