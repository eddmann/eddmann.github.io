    <time datetime="2019-01-29T00:00:00-06:00" class="post-date">29 Jan 2019</time>
    <p>Over the Christmas break I found myself on a bit of a nostalgic gaming journey.
Along with building a <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a>, I dusted off my old Game Boy and decided to â€˜catch them allâ€™ one more time on PokÃ©mon Red.
Whilst playing, the developer in me started to contrive how a game like this was created, and better still could be changed.
Enter <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered">pokered</a>, a disassembly of PokÃ©mon Red/Blue which has been organised so that an assembly code noice like myself can understand it.
In this post I will go through compiling the ASM, tweaking the game to add <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/pokered/commit/e2d6662bc13348234d58a262e9d6faef0a2507de">â€˜Super Bâ€™ button behaviour</a>, and then running the compiled ROM on an actual handheld!
</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I donâ€™t condone piracy and personally own both PokÃ©mon Red/Blue game cartridges that this project is based on.</p>

<h3 id="compiling-pokered-using-docker">Compiling pokered using Docker</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered">pokered</a> Git repository is well documented, including the steps required to compile the given assembly code for the desired platform.
However, being an advocate of Docker I wished to take it a step further an Dockerise this process.
To do this I created the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> below, which uses a small <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/minideb">Debian base image</a> to install all the required dependencies with.</p>

<div class="language-docker highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> bitnami/minideb:stretch</span>
<span class="k">RUN </span>install_packages make git gcc byacc flex pkg-config libpng-dev ca-certificates
<span class="k">RUN </span>git clone https://github.com/rednex/rgbds /opt/rgbds <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> make <span class="nt">-C</span> /opt/rgbds <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nt">-fr</span> /opt/rgbds
<span class="k">RUN </span><span class="nb">mkdir</span> /opt/src
<span class="k">WORKDIR</span><span class="s"> /opt/src</span>
<span class="k">CMD</span><span class="s"> ["make", "all"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From here I then compiled and pushed <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/eddmann/pokered">this image</a> to Docker Hub and created a small executable <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-make</code> script within the root of the repository.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
docker run <span class="nt">-v</span> <span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">pwd</span><span class="si">)</span>:/opt/src eddmann/pokered make <span class="nv">$@</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allowed me to seamlessly run all provided <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> targets within the Docker container like so <code class="highlighter-rouge">./docker-make all</code>.
Once complete, two new build artifacts were now present in the root of the repository - <code class="highlighter-rouge">pokered.gbc</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">pokeblue.gbc</code>.
Both these ROMs were now playable using a desktop/web Game Boy emulator like <a href="https://wasmboy.app/">wasmboy</a>. ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h3 id="adding-the-super-b-button-behaviour">Adding the â€˜Super Bâ€™ button behaviour</h3>

<p>Now that I could now compile the game into a working ROM, my mind began thinking of all the small tweaks to the game I would like to experiment with.
One aspect of the original that always felt time consuming was when trying to get to a destination in a hurry and be caught out by many wild PokÃ©mon (without <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Repel">Repel</a> active) and trainer-battle encounters.
I started to review the code-base to see if there was a way of taking advantage of when the B button was pressed, possibly temporarily preventing these two activities.</p>

<h4 id="prevent-wild-pokÃ©mon-encounters">Prevent Wild PokÃ©mon Encounters</h4>

<p>It turns out that the game had an unused <a href="https://tcrf.net/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue/Debug_Functions#Debug_Mode">debug mode</a> that was left in, which provided one part of this behaviour.
As such I was able to tweak <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/pokered/commit/e2d6662bc13348234d58a262e9d6faef0a2507de#diff-126f3527215b40b1dc53ffe1ff45b479"><code class="highlighter-rouge">engine/battle/core.asm</code></a> to prevent wild PokÃ©mon encounters if the B button was pressed.</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">DetermineWildOpponent:
</span><span class="gd">- ld a, [wd732]
- bit 1, a
- jr z, .asm_3ef2f
</span>  ld a, [hJoyHeld]
<span class="gd">- bit 1, a ; B button pressed?
</span><span class="gi">+ and B_BUTTON
</span>  ret nz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This tweak simply removes the check for if the debug mode is enabled and short-circuits the action if the B button is pressed.</p>

<h4 id="prevent-trainer-battle-encounters">Prevent Trainer Battle Encounters</h4>

<p>Following this, I now hoped to follow a similar pattern in temporarily preventing trainer battle encounters.
I was able to achieve this by making some minor modifications to <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/pokered/commit/e2d6662bc13348234d58a262e9d6faef0a2507de#diff-33f8ea117b558305b57c03b757e4ef64"><code class="highlighter-rouge">home.asm</code></a>.</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">CheckFightingMapTrainers::
</span><span class="gi">+ ld a, [hJoyHeld]
+ and B_BUTTON
+ jr nz, .noFight
</span>
  call CheckForEngagingTrainers
  ld a, [wSpriteIndex]
  cp $ff
  jr nz, .trainerEngaging
<span class="gi">+ .noFight
</span>  xor a
  ld [wSpriteIndex], a
  ld [wTrainerHeaderFlagBit], a
  ret
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a similar manor to how we prevented wild PokÃ©mon encounters, if the B button is pressed we jump to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.noFight</code>, skipping the <code class="highlighter-rouge">CheckForEngagingTrainers</code> call.
Once compiled, I was able to experiment with these two changes and found them to be very interesting additions to game play.</p>

<h4 id="walking-through-walls">Walking Through Walls</h4>

<p>I then thought wouldnâ€™t it be cool to accommodate for a similar â€˜walk through wallsâ€™ glitch behaviour that you see in certain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5naL4X1vUbE">speed runs</a>.
As such I delved back into the code-base and made a small modification to <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/pokered/commit/e2d6662bc13348234d58a262e9d6faef0a2507de#diff-3dcdb47cbd60e627ff3c82d83193112c"><code class="highlighter-rouge">home/overworld.asm</code></a> which provided me with this capability.</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">.noDirectionChange</span>
  ld a, [wPlayerDirection] ; current direction
  ld [wPlayerMovingDirection], a ; save direction
  call UpdateSprites

+ ld a, [hJoyHeld]
<span class="gi">+ and B_BUTTON
+ jr nz, .noCollision
</span>
  ld a, [wWalkBikeSurfState]
  cp $02 ; surfing
  jr z, .surfing
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After another compile I was now able to not only prevent wild PokÃ©mon and trainer battle encounters, but also â€˜walk through wallsâ€™ when desired.
You can see a small clip below of how game play is altered when the â€˜Super Bâ€™ button is pressed.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/compiling-pokered-using-docker-and-adding-super-b-button-behaviour/superb.gif" alt="Super B Button" /></p>

<p>Due to the effort put into making the pokered project so readable, I found it very easy to work my way through the code-base and locate the areas of interest to experiment with.
The people behind this disassembly have also worked on doing the same for <a href="https://github.com/pret">many other</a> PokÃ©mon releases.</p>

<h3 id="playing-on-a-handheld">Playing on a Handheld</h3>

<p>With this modifications in place I ideally wished to now use this new behaviour on a handled console, as opposed to just through a desktop emulator.
To achieve this I purchased an <a href="http://www.ezflash.cn/product/omega/">EZ-Flash Omega</a> cartridge for the GBA which allowed me to transfer these ROMs onto a micro-SD card.
Now I could play these games on a backlit screen using my Nintendo DS Lite. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
