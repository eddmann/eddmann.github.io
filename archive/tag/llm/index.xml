It&amp;rsquo;s been another busy week with work and spending any free time I do have with these LLMs, exploring many different things along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weeknotes: Model Personalities, Building My Own Agent, and Two Schools of Agentic Development</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/weeknotes-model-personalities-building-my-own-agent-and-two-schools-of-agentic-development/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/weeknotes-model-personalities-building-my-own-agent-and-two-schools-of-agentic-development/</guid><description>&lt;p>We made it to week two.
This one&amp;rsquo;s been heavy on building - a coding agent harness, a labour contraction timer, a desktop diff reviewer - but also on reflecting on how I&amp;rsquo;m actually using these tools and what patterns are emerging.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running MCPs Everywhere: Chatting with My Workouts</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/running-mcps-everywhere-chatting-with-my-workouts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/running-mcps-everywhere-chatting-with-my-workouts/</guid><description>As both a runner and someone curious about MCPs, I wanted to chat about my workouts with an LLM. This led me to build Strava and Garmin Connect MCP servers, exploring the Python/FastMCP stack and discovering patterns for designing effective MCP tools. The result: a system that lets Claude/ChatGPT generate throwaway code to analyse my training data in ways I never anticipated.</description></item><item><title>Contextual Movie Conversations: Building a Plex MCP Server</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/contextual-movie-conversations-building-a-plex-mcp-server/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/contextual-movie-conversations-building-a-plex-mcp-server/</guid><description>An exploration of building a Plex MCP server using Laravel 12 and Laravel MCP. By integrating Plex playback sessions with OpenSubtitles, I created a system that lets AI assistants understand exactly where I am in a film - perfect for catching up on missed plot points or diving deeper into themes while watching.</description></item><item><title>santa-lang Workshop: Exploring Agentic LLM Workflows for Language Implementation</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/santa-lang-workshop-exploring-agentic-llm-workflows-for-language-implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/santa-lang-workshop-exploring-agentic-llm-workflows-for-language-implementation/</guid><description>Exploring how AI agents can implement programming languages from scratch. The santa-lang Workshop provides a structured approach using shared PHPT-style tests, Docker isolation, and stage-gated development to compare how different harnesses and models tackle the same language specification across multiple programming languages.</description></item><item><title>Vibe Coding a Chess UI: Building on the ESP32 with Cursor &amp; LVGL</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/vibe-coding-a-chess-ui-building-on-the-esp32-with-cursor-and-lvgl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/vibe-coding-a-chess-ui-building-on-the-esp32-with-cursor-and-lvgl/</guid><description>In this post, I share my experience using AI-driven tools like Cursor, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s o3 to rapidly prototype an embedded chess UI on the ESP32 microcontroller using LVGL. Letting the AI handle implementation allowed me to stay focused on high-level design, iterate quickly, and stay in flow. Hype aside, it&amp;rsquo;s a powerful tool for exploring ideas faster.</description></item><item><title>How I Used ChatGPT to Fix My Old Blog Posts (And What I Learned)</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/how-i-used-chatgpt-to-fix-my-old-blog-posts-and-what-i-learned/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/how-i-used-chatgpt-to-fix-my-old-blog-posts-and-what-i-learned/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past week, I have dedicated some of my free time to a long-overdue blog redesign.
During this process, I stumbled upon several glaring spelling mistakes in older posts, which led me down the path of manually reviewing all my previous entries.
This felt a lot like &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">yak shaving&lt;/a>, prompting me to consider whether leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) could be an effective solution to this problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using LangChain Agents and Tools to answer questions on the NBA with OpenAI</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/using-langchain-agents-and-tools-to-answer-questions-on-the-nba-with-openai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/using-langchain-agents-and-tools-to-answer-questions-on-the-nba-with-openai/</guid><description>&lt;p>Large language models (OpenAI/ChatGPT in particular) are all the rage at the moment.
