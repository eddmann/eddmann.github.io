It&amp;rsquo;s been another busy week with work and spending any free time I do have with these LLMs, exploring many different things along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weeknotes: Model Personalities, Building My Own Agent, and Two Schools of Agentic Development</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/weeknotes-model-personalities-building-my-own-agent-and-two-schools-of-agentic-development/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/weeknotes-model-personalities-building-my-own-agent-and-two-schools-of-agentic-development/</guid><description>&lt;p>We made it to week two.

There&amp;rsquo;s a lot happening with agents and LLM tooling right now, and I feel like personally this stuff is changing so quickly that to have a reference back to my previous experience could be useful.
So here we are: weeknotes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
