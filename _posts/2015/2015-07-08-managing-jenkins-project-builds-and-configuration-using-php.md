Throughout project development we use Jenkins to provide meaningful test feedback on each Git push event.
These builds are required for a sufficient amount of confidence to be gained for merging into *master* and subsequently deployment.
Each member of the team has their own project which they manage with the current project/branch they are working on.
However, typically we find ourselves working on multiple branches throughout the day, and it can become cumbersome to update the projects configuration.
