In the tradition of over-engineering a problem related to our wedding, we really did not want resized/compressed photos shared through WhatsApp/iMessage of the big day.
So instead, I decided to create a serverless photo gallery that provided guests with the ability to share the original photos in one place.
I also wanted to explore the ability to achieve this while having 100% feature parity locally in a development setting.
In this post, I would like to discuss how I went about building these photo-upload/resizing and lazy-loaded gallery capabilities using AWS Lambda, S3 and DynamoDB.

Like in previous projects, I used the <a href=https://www.serverless.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Serverless Framework</a> to manage deploying the transient application while leaving the foundational building blocks for Terraform.
Each API endpoint&rsquo;s functionality is split into individually packaged artefacts using <a href=https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-esbuild rel="external noopener" target=_blank>esbuild</a> for bundling and transpilation.
This provides smaller artefacts that only contain the dependencies (such as Sharp, AWS-SDK) which are actually required within each of the desired endpoints.</p><h3 id=persistence>Persistence</h3><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/nosql-workbench_hu_45251a5b0092c714.webp 350w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/nosql-workbench_hu_62c5f78ca49af611.webp 700w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/nosql-workbench_hu_1b6115ac60073a15.webp 1400w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/nosql-workbench_hu_5362ede50e01830e.jpg 350w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/nosql-workbench_hu_f7c2cfbf52564106.jpg 700w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/nosql-workbench_hu_5587ede0eaff249.jpg 1400w"><img src=/posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/nosql-workbench_hu_f7c2cfbf52564106.jpg alt="The DynamoDB table schema" loading=lazy></picture></p><p>For storing the photo metadata and gallery listing (used for infinite scroll), I opted to use a <a href=https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-single-table/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Single-Table Design</a> DynamoDB table.
This uses the <code>PK</code>/<code>SK</code> and <code>GSI*PK</code>/<code>GSI*SK</code> partition/sort key pattern found in Single-Table Design, allowing optimal data retrieval based on predefined access patterns.</p><p>The <code>GSI1PK</code> is used as a <em>hot key</em> 😬 for listing the gallery photos in sorted processed timestamp order, using the last evaluated key as a marker to progressively provide the <em>next</em> batch of gallery photos to the client.
Using a <em>hot key</em> is not best practice, but based on this usage pattern and load, it suffices for this use case.</p><p>In its current form, the use of a <em>Single-Table Design</em> may seem unnecessary since the application lacks multiple access patterns and concerns.
However, there is future scope to better showcase the idea with additional functionality, such as photo comments.</p><h3 id=photo-upload-and-resizing>Photo Upload and Resizing</h3><p>Uploaded photos are stored within an initial <em>upload</em> S3 bucket using pre-signed <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-UsingHTTPPOST.html rel="external noopener" target=_blank>form POST requests</a>, which are generated by the API based on a pre-request supplied by the client.
Upon successful photo upload, the resulting <code>s3:ObjectCreated</code> event triggers a Lambda function responsible for moving the photo to the <em>persistent</em> S3 bucket and generating resized web and thumbnail variants in WebP (using <a href=https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Node.js Sharp</a>).
At the end of this process, a record with the photo&rsquo;s metadata is stored in the DynamoDB table for inclusion in the gallery response.
The initial <em>upload</em> S3 bucket uses a lifecycle rule to clean up any failed photo uploads after seven days.</p><h3 id=local-development>Local Development</h3><p>As stated above, one of my goals was to have local feature parity for development purposes.
Thanks to a combination of <a href=https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-offline rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Serverless Offline</a>, <a href=https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-dynamodb-local rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Serverless DynamoDB Local</a>, and <a href=https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-s3-local rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Serverless S3 Local</a>, I was able to achieve just that 🎉.
I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to replicate both pre-signing S3 POST requests and handling S3 event triggers thanks to <a href=https://github.com/jamhall/s3rver rel="external noopener" target=_blank>s3rver</a>.
Doing this allowed me to have greater confidence in my implementation before deploying it to AWS.</p><h2 id=the-client>The Client</h2><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/gallery_hu_19c36ec93dcfee32.webp 350w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/gallery_hu_e8bfbef774856d36.webp 700w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/gallery_hu_ac18a9fde0768ad8.webp 744w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/gallery_hu_30a448be38ab465d.jpg 350w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/gallery_hu_b3353b8bf8d88ca1.jpg 700w, /posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/gallery_hu_e6c4b729e0a334b7.jpg 744w"><img src=/posts/building-a-serverless-wedding-photo-gallery-using-aws-lambda-s3-and-dynamodb/gallery_hu_b3353b8bf8d88ca1.jpg alt="The lazy-loaded photo gallery" loading=lazy>

I used this project as an opportunity to explore <a href=https://tailwindcss.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Tailwind CSS</a> for presentational concerns.
The client is built statically within the <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-gallery/tree/main/.github/workflows rel="external noopener" target=_blank>build pipeline</a>, distributed via S3, and fronted by CloudFront.
To ensure only authorised users have access to the gallery, a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-infra/blob/main/stage/apps/gallery/resources/viewer-request.js rel="external noopener" target=_blank>CloudFront function</a> enforces that shared HTTP Basic Authentication credentials are supplied.
As the same CloudFront distribution is used to front the client, API, and S3 buckets, we can be certain that all requests are protected by these security measures.</p><h3 id=photo-lazy-loading-and-lightbox>Photo Lazy Loading and Lightbox</h3><p>The gallery is presented as an <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-gallery/blob/main/client/src/component/PhotoGallery.js rel="external noopener" target=_blank>infinite scrollable list</a>, which progressively (lazily) requests the <em>next</em> available batch of photos.
When a photo is clicked on, a full-screen <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-gallery/blob/main/client/src/component/Lightbox.js rel="external noopener" target=_blank>lightbox variant</a> is displayed, providing the ability to visually swipe back and forth (on mobile devices) between photos.
Effectively handling touch events, with graceful desktop mouse click fallback, was an interesting challenge using React Hooks.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>I really enjoyed the chance to add additional functionality that could be hosted within the infrastructure project I had set up for our wedding website.
Being able to replicate all the behaviour within a local setting was very satisfying, enabling a quick REPL for API/client development.
I was also very happy with the decision to structure both the client and API in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo rel="external noopener" target=_blank>monorepo</a>, with independent <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-gallery/tree/main/.github/workflows rel="external noopener" target=_blank>build pipelines</a> for any changes that are pushed.</p><p>Finally, after seeing how this gallery has been used in practice, I feel the addition of handling video media would be a great future improvement.
Using <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>AWS Elemental MediaConvert</a> as a possible means to process uploaded video media could provide similar <em>elastic compute</em> functionality that Node.js Sharp, hosted on Lambda, does for photos.</p></main><footer class=post__tags><a href=/archive/tag/aws>aws</a><a href=/archive/tag/lambda>lambda</a><a href=/archive/tag/s3>s3</a><a href=/archive/tag/dynamodb>dynamodb</a><a href=/archive/tag/serverless>serverless</a></footer></article><div class="related-posts u-prose"><h3>Related Posts</h3><ul><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-viewing-and-removing-mince-pies-with-amazon-dynamodb/>Mince Pie Challenge: Viewing and Removing Mince Pies with Amazon DynamoDB</a></li><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-adding-and-listing-mince-pies-with-amazon-dynamodb/>Mince Pie Challenge: Adding and Listing Mince Pies with Amazon DynamoDB</a></li><li><a href=/posts/managing-long-running-aws-fargate-ecs-tasks-within-your-serverless-project/>Managing long-running AWS Fargate ECS tasks within your Serverless project</a></li><li><a href=/posts/separating-out-the-lambda-bref-runtime-from-your-projects-composer-dependencies/>Separating out the Lambda Bref runtime from your project's Composer dependencies</a></li><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-building-a-serverless-restful-api-and-react-client/>Mince Pie Challenge: Building a Serverless RESTful API and React Client</a></li></ul></div><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer l-wrapper"><div>&copy; 2025, Edd Mann</div><button class=site-footer__theme-toggle type=button title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg fill="currentcolor" viewBox="0 0 32 32" role="img"><title>Theme toggle icon</title><desc>A circle representing the moon for toggling theme</desc><path d="M16 .5C7.4.5.5 7.4.5 16S7.4 31.5 16 31.5 31.5 24.6 31.5 16 24.6.5 16 .5zm0 28.1V3.4C23 3.4 28.6 9 28.6 16S23 28.6 16 28.6z"/></svg></button></footer></body></html>
