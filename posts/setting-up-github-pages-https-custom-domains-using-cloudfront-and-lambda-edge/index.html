<p>We recently wished to switch over our sites hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to be soley HTTPS.
However, although you are able to supply a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">custom domain</a> or support <a href="https://github.com/blog/2186-https-for-github-pages">HTTPS traffic</a> you are not able to do both.
In this article I would like to guide you through the process of how we went about achieving this using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Route 53</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/">Lambda@Edge</a>.
