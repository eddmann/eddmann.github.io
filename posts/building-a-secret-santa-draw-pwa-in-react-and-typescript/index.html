The final build includes the ability to create Secret Santa draws in both a local and remote setting, using Redux to manage the application state.
I wanted the application to be standalone, whereby all its behaviour could be deployed as a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/secret-santa-pwa/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml rel="external noopener" target=_blank>static artefact</a> on GitHub Pages.
I did not want to integrate it directly with an SMS provider like I have in past years, instead opting to use the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Web Share API</a> to craft a message with a unique URL to access each participant&rsquo;s draw result.
On top of this, I did not want a dependency on remote persistence (to store the draw results), so I had to devise a means of passing the draw results within this shared URL.</p><h3 id=local-draw>Local draw</h3><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-local-draw_hu_b42777b10ecf5685.webp 350w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-local-draw_hu_b0a645537287c92d.webp 700w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-local-draw_hu_f11f284822011a84.webp 1170w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-local-draw_hu_182e3e77d5fe9645.jpg 350w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-local-draw_hu_e3f8347b3b136221.jpg 700w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-local-draw_hu_30c60596c68c58a.jpg 1170w"><img src=/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-local-draw_hu_e3f8347b3b136221.jpg alt="Local Draw" loading=lazy>

Once the draw has been completed, each allocation is presented one after another with the device being passed around to each requested participant until everyone knows who they are Secret Santa for.
To ensure that participants do not accidentally see the next participant&rsquo;s allocation, I added a multi-step process to reveal the result.
Throughout development, I was able to sprinkle in several CSS animations to aid in the overall UX, one of which was fading in the recipient&rsquo;s name upon being revealed.</p><h3 id=remote-draw>Remote draw</h3><p><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-remote-draw_hu_f1165b9c7cdba4db.webp 350w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-remote-draw_hu_917bc66529d397ed.webp 700w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-remote-draw_hu_1518c83937731695.webp 1170w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-remote-draw_hu_7be6cb19d0e04ae.jpg 350w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-remote-draw_hu_6c5c22b44aa29305.jpg 700w, /posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-remote-draw_hu_9d09acbe4fc95607.jpg 1170w"><img src=/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-remote-draw_hu_6c5c22b44aa29305.jpg alt="Remote Draw" loading=lazy>

When the encrypted URL is visited, the participant is presented with a similar screen to a local draw, where they can reveal who they are Secret Santa for.
Being encrypted (using the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Web Crypto API</a>), the user of the device who completed the draw (and was tasked with sharing the results) is unable to <em>snoop</em> on each allocation.
As all state about the allocation is stored within the URL, there is no need for remote state persistence, and the application can remain a simple SPA deployed on <a href=.github/workflows/release.yml>GitHub Actions</a> 🎉.</p><h3 id=draw-history>Draw history</h3><p>Each draw is persisted locally on the device using the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Web Storage API</a>.
This allows the user to retrieve the results again after the draw has taken place.
Going forward, it may be beneficial to review other means of persisting state on the web, e.g. <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API rel="external noopener" target=_blank>IndexedDB</a>.
Currently, the draw results stored within the Redux state are subscribed to and persisted upon each store change.
This is a little unperformant as we are required to encode and write JSON entities anytime the store changes, but this will suffice for the initial release.</p><h3 id=snowfall>Snowfall</h3><video style=width:100% preload=metadata controls muted>
<source src=/posts/building-a-secret-santa-draw-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/ios-loading.mp4 type=video/mp4>Your browser does not support the video element.</video><p>There is a small <em>easter egg</em> on the application&rsquo;s home screen.
Using the <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent rel="external noopener" target=_blank>DeviceMotionEvent</a>, when you shake the device, the amount and speed of the snow falling increases.
On iOS, the user is required to give permission to the application to read this information.
As such, they are required to click the small bottom-right phone icon (if it appears) before shaking the device.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Like previous years, I have enjoyed exploring another means of taking the problem of allocating Secret Santa and applying it to a project to learn new technologies.
This build has expanded my understanding of what is possible within a Progressive Web Application using many more Web APIs.
Over the last day or so, I have been looking at the possibility of packaging this PWA into a native iOS and Android application using <a href=https://capacitorjs.com/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Capacitor</a>.
I hope to find some time to release this onto the Google Play and App Store and document my experience in doing so in the future.</p></main><footer class=post-footer><ul class="tags tags--large"><li><a href=/archive/tag/pwa>pwa</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/react>react</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/typescript>typescript</a></li></ul><div class=related><h3 class=related__title>Related Posts</h3><ul class=related__posts><li><a href=/posts/building-a-running-calculator-pwa-in-react-and-typescript/>Building a Running Calculator PWA in React and TypeScript</a></li><li><a href=/posts/building-a-rubik-cube-solver-using-rust-wasm-threejs-and-react/>Building a Rubik's Cube Solver using Rust/WASM and Three.js/React</a></li><li><a href=/posts/building-an-optimal-pocket-cube-solver-using-rust-wasm-threejs-and-react/>Building an optimal Pocket Cube (2x2x2) Solver using Rust/WASM and Three.js/React</a></li><li><a href=/posts/creating-a-react-based-chess-game-with-wasm-bots-in-typescript/>Creating a React-based Chess Game with WASM Bots in TypeScript</a></li><li><a href=/posts/designing-santa-lang-a-language-for-solving-advent-of-code-puzzles/>Designing santa-lang, a language for solving Advent of Code puzzles</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer l-wrapper"><div>&copy; 2025, Edd Mann</div><button class=site-footer__theme-toggle type=button title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg fill="currentcolor" viewBox="0 0 32 32" role="img"><title>Theme toggle icon</title><desc>A circle representing the moon for toggling theme</desc><path d="M16 .5C7.4.5.5 7.4.5 16S7.4 31.5 16 31.5 31.5 24.6 31.5 16 24.6.5 16 .5zm0 28.1V3.4C23 3.4 28.6 9 28.6 16S23 28.6 16 28.6z"/></svg></button></footer></body></html>
