            <p>Large-language models (OpenAI/ChatGPT in particular) are all the rage at the moment, and like many developers I am interested at exploring what is possible with this new technology.
This article documents my experience exploring how to implement <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/">Q&amp;A Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (RAG) using LangChain and the <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">Chroma</a> vector database.</p>

            <p>December has come and gone, and the dust has settled on completing the Advent of Code 2022 calendar.
As highlighted in my <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/designing-santa-lang-a-language-for-solving-advent-of-code-puzzles/">previous post</a>, I wanted to complete this year’s puzzles using my own programming language, santa-lang, which I have tailored to help aid in solving such problems.
In this article I want to discuss this experience, how the language aided in solution development, and where additions/changes were made to improve it along the way.</p>

            <p>Over the past several years I have been slowly working <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2015">my</a> <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2016/python">way</a> <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017/rust">through</a> the previous Advent of Code calendars.
For each calendar I opt to solve the puzzles in a new programming language, to familiarise myself with other ways of understanding and working.
However, there comes a time in each calendar that I grow to dislike some aspect of the language.
So I had an idea… why not give this whole programming language design a go.
That way if I grow to dislike the language, I only have myself to blame!</p>

            <p>Over the past several years, I have taken the opportunity of allocating Secret Santas for members of my family as an excuse to explore different <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/allocating-and-notifying-secret-santas-via-email-using-clojure/">programming languages</a> and <a href="https://eddmann.com/posts/building-a-secret-santa-allocator-and-sms-sender-using-a-raspberry-pi-pico-micropython-and-sim800l-module/">technologies</a>.
This year has been no different, with me opting to <em>over-engineer</em> the problem of allocating and notifying participants by diving into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">AWS Step Functions</a> and the many runtimes available on Lambda.
In this post, I wish to document how I went about designing the Step Function workflow and breaking up the problem into many specific-purpose Lambda behaviours.
The final implementation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/step-function-secret-santa">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

            <p>Whilst <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-infra#stage-applications">documenting</a> how I structured the <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-infra">infrastructure</a> used for hosting our wedding website, I mentioned the possibility of showcasing its use for another application concern.
In the tradition of over-engineering a problem related to our wedding, we really did not want resized/compressed photos shared through WhatsApp/iMessage of the big day.
So instead, I decided to create a serverless photo gallery that provided guests with the ability to share the original photos in one place.
I also wanted to explore the ability to achieve this while having 100% feature parity locally in a development setting.
In this post, I would like to discuss how I went about building these photo-upload/resizing and lazy-loaded gallery capabilities using AWS Lambda, S3 and DynamoDB.
The final implementation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-gallery">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
