            <p>Partial function application is a commonplace feature found in many languages that lean towards the functional paradigm.
Unlike some functional concepts (monads), it can be simply explained as taking a function and binding argument values to one or more of its parameters, resulting in a new function.
Function argument size in computer science circles is described as its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity">arity</a>, and through this process we are reducing the arity based on the partial application call.
Discussion of partial application typically brings up the related topic of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a>, which follows the stricter rule of transforming a multiple-argument function into a chain of single-argument calls.
This is useful as it helps simplify the study of functions in theoretical computer science, such as lambda calculus.
Currying, however, is not that useful in general-purpose languages, unlike Haskell which, at its core, only supports the mathematical notion of single-argument functions.
Using a combination of syntactic sugar and currying, the language is able to give the misguided impression of multi-argument calls, when in fact it is just a chain of single-argument curried calls.</p>

            <p>Following on from my previous post on implementing a <a href="/posts/implementing-a-stack-in-java-using-arrays-and-linked-lists/">stack</a> in Java, I now wish to discuss the equally important queue data structure.
Similar to the restrictions placed upon the stack implementation, the queue only allows mutation via two methods.
Addition (enqueue) occurs at the end of the collection, and removal (dequeue) from the beginning, resulting in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure.
Queues are typically used as buffers to store data, objects, and events that are to be held for future sequential processing.
As discussed in the post on stacks, you are more than likely never going to have to implement such a data structure in practical use cases, as the language libraries will already include such an implementation (i.e. <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/queue/queue/">C++ STL</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splqueue.php">PHP SplQueue</a>).</p>

            <p>The Shunting Yard algorithm was developed by the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra">Edsger Dijkstra</a> as a means to parse an infix mathematical expression into Reverse Polish notation (postfix).
Using this notation allows the computer to evaluate the expression in a simple stack-based form, <a href="/posts/reverse-polish-notation-rpn-in-scala/">examples</a> of which I have shown in Scala previously.
The algorithm itself also uses a stack along with a built-up output string to create the resulting value.
Below is an example implementation which only takes into consideration brackets and the four common operator precedences.
Although it is possible to evaluate more, including functions and associativity, I decided to keep the implementation simple to better highlight the process.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, YouTube does not provide you with the ability to upload audio tracks individually, which can be inconvenient if you do not work with video (such as a podcast).
The way to get around this limitation is to create a video which includes the desired audio track and a fixed image (i.e. cover art) which lasts the duration of the track.
There are many ways of achieving such a result, from iMovie and Windows Movie Maker to the online service <a href="http://www.tunestotube.com/">TunesToTube</a>.
With a little <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/YouTube">research</a>, however, I was able to come up with an even simpler solution that only requires the ever-useful <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org">ffmpeg</a>.</p>

            <p>The stack is a fundamental data structure used extensively in algorithm design and program implementation.
At an abstract level, it can be described very simply, as it only allows for the addition (pushing) of new elements and the removal (popping) of existing elements from the top of the stack.
This description can be abbreviated to LIFO, which stands for Last-In-First-Out.
Although you will most likely not have to implement such a structure for practical use cases, it can be very useful to ‘look under the hood’ to gain a better understanding of what is going on.
Doing so will make you more aware of when this data structure can be best used.</p>
