This keeps everyone <em>in the loop</em> with the work that the tech team are carrying out and how the system is changing over time.
Last year, MyBuilder transitioned away from Jenkins to GitHub Actions to manage our CI pipelines, and in the process, we were able to revise how we notified interested parties about releases.</p><p>We have been using <a href=https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Release Drafter</a> for several years now (even before transitioning to Actions) and really like how it provides a frictionless means of relaying changes through compiled release notes from GitHub pull requests.
The ability to additionally tag pull requests and produce sectionable release notes is very useful.
Adopting GitHub Actions, we now had an easy means of additionally triggering actions based on GitHub events such as successful deployment ðŸ˜Ž.</p><p>Our primary means of release notification were in the form of Gone Live emails, which required manual effort to send out the release notes to the company once the changes had been deployed.
One of the key drivers of the SRE team at MyBuilder is <a href=https://sre.google/workbook/eliminating-toil/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>eliminating toil</a>, and we had pinpointed this as a case that needed review.
With the move to GitHub Actions, we could now harness the power of the provided event system and workflows to automate the process.
Upon review, we also felt it useful to provide the ability for members of staff to review Gone Live release notes within a dedicated Slack channel, as this had overtaken email as the primary communication platform.</p><h2 id=what-we-wanted>What We Wanted</h2><p>We wanted a means of automatically notifying interested parties of Gone Live release notes via both Email and Slack channels upon successful deployment, without any manual intervention.
Better still, it would be great if we could additionally <a href=https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack rel="external noopener" target=_blank><em>mention</em></a> members of the tech team within the Slack notification based on their involvement.
So with this in mind, I was able to spend a day building several GitHub Actions that solved these two use cases.</p><h2 id=email-release-notifier>Email Release Notifier</h2><p><a href=https://github.com/eddmann/email-release-notifier rel="external noopener" target=_blank><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/using-github-actions-to-send-gone-live-release-notes-via-email-and-slack/email-notification_hu_9ce52c15345cca5e.webp 350w, /posts/using-github-actions-to-send-gone-live-release-notes-via-email-and-slack/email-notification_hu_3cc5acb58216be8f.webp 700w, /posts/using-github-actions-to-send-gone-live-release-notes-via-email-and-slack/email-notification_hu_529458928a43877e.webp 1400w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/using-github-actions-to-send-gone-live-release-notes-via-email-and-slack/email-notification_hu_f4c75d104c319b2c.jpg 350w, /posts/using-github-actions-to-send-gone-live-release-notes-via-email-and-slack/email-notification_hu_27c72cde1b0a5c73.jpg 700w, /posts/using-github-actions-to-send-gone-live-release-notes-via-email-and-slack/email-notification_hu_f56a49dcb93d8624.jpg 1400w"><img src=/posts/using-github-actions-to-send-gone-live-release-notes-via-email-and-slack/email-notification_hu_27c72cde1b0a5c73.jpg alt loading=lazy></picture></a></p><p>The completed Email release notifier is available for review and use <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/email-release-notifier rel="external noopener" target=_blank>on GitHub</a>.
When a release is published within GitHub, the contents are stored as Markdown.
As such, we were required to convert this Markdown to HTML so it could be presented in an Email.
This was trivial thanks to having access to not only a Node runtime but also the ability to package NPM dependencies.
We have been using SendGrid for handling email at MyBuilder for many years and opted to use their SDK/API to send out the actual email on our behalf.</p><p>With the new GitHub Action, we were now able to bind it to the successful deployment event (as shown below) and remove the need for any more manual tasks!</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>name</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>Notify Team via Email about Release</span>

In this case, we wanted to not only send it to a desired shared channel but also provide a means of <em>mentioning</em> tech team members based on relevant pull request changes going live.
Slack&rsquo;s <a href=https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Webhook support</a> allows you to build complex messages using constructs such as <em>blocks</em>.
These <em>blocks</em> can handle a subset of Markdown, which was useful regarding the release notes that had been generated.
As the Release Drafter has a means to include all the contributor GitHub usernames within the compiled release, it was a trivial task to replace these occurrences with their associated Slack member identities (by way of a lookup table input).
This meant that when a release had Gone Live and the subsequent Slack notification had been sent, interested parties would be alerted to this news instantaneously.</p><p>In a similar fashion to how we were able to wire up the Email release notifier, we could bind to the same successful deployment event for Slack communications too.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>name</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>Notify Team via Slack about Release</span>

The rich set of GitHub events you can trigger behaviour on is invaluable and makes automating tasks such as this easy to achieve.
Now that we have moved our entire CI pipeline over to GitHub Actions, I hope to be able to take more advantage of these capabilities in time to come.</p></main><footer class=post__tags><a href=/archive/tag/github-actions>github-actions</a><a href=/archive/tag/slack>slack</a><a href=/archive/tag/email>email</a></footer></article><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer wrapper"><div>&copy; 2025, Edd Mann</div><button class=theme-toggle type=button title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg fill="currentcolor" viewBox="0 0 32 32" role="img"><title>Theme toggle icon</title><desc>A circle representing the moon for toggling theme</desc><path d="M16 .5C7.4.5.5 7.4.5 16S7.4 31.5 16 31.5 31.5 24.6 31.5 16 24.6.5 16 .5zm0 28.1V3.4C23 3.4 28.6 9 28.6 16S23 28.6 16 28.6z"/></svg></button></footer></body></html>
