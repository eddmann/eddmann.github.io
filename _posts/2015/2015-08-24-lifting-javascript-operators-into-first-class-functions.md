I have always enjoyed how succinctly you are able to use commonly found operators as first-class functions in languages such as [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).
As a quick thought experiment I decided to see if it would be possible to use JavaScript's capabilities to [dynamically create functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function), to mimic such behaviour.

This experiment resulted in the code you see below, permitting the lifting of operators into functions which can be passed around and used as expected.

```js
let assoc = (ops, fn) =>
  ops
    .split(' ')
    .reduce((obj, op) => { obj[op] = fn(op); return obj; }, {});

let infix = assoc('+ - * /', op => Function('a', 'b', `return a ${op} b`));
let prefix = assoc('! ++ --', op => Function('a', `return ${op} a`));
let postfix = assoc('()', op => Function('a', `return a ${op}`));

let ƒ = (op) => infix[op] || prefix[op] || postfix[op];

[1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(ƒ('+'));
```
