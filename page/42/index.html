            <p>Continuing on with my exploration of the Scala language I decided to solve the widely documented problem of evaluating a mathematical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation">Reverse Polish notation</a> string.
Popularised by its use in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-10C_series">HP-10C</a> series of calculators from the 1980’s, the notation requires that every operator follow its operands (otherwise called postfix notation).</p>

            <p>Git has two different types of timestamp associated with a commit.
Although both may typically hold the same value they are used in subtly different ways.
The author (GIT_AUTHOR_DATE) is the user who originally created the work (i.e. a patch), where as the committer (GIT_COMMITTER_DATE) is the user who last applied the work (i.e. applied patch or rebase).
The author date is the one displayed when the log is accessed, however, the commit date is used when given the filter (–since, –until) options, which seems a little odd.
To avoid confusion you can include the committer date within your log display by setting the –format option.</p>

            <p>Having to use password authentication each time you wish to access your server can be a serious pain.
Not only does it require extra keystrokes, it is also less secure and far more susceptible to successful brute-force attacks.
Enter public-key authentication, were instead you use asymmetric cryptography.
The first thing to do is generate a key-pair on your client machine, you can optional provide a passphrase to unlock the private key if you so wish.</p>

            <p>Scala can be a very deceptive language, type-inference is a very good example of this.
Another less understood example that you will soon be welcome to upon closer exploration of the language is the ‘for-comprehension’.
The first point I wish to highlight is that in Scala everything is an expression which returns a value, even if this be Unit (which is equivalent to nothing).
This is a fundamental design principle of Scala which allows for productive use of its functional nature.
In an imperative manner for example, we have become very accustom to maybe declaring and assigning a default value, only to reassign it with another if a condition is meet on the next line.
Due to the expressive nature of the language this can instead be condensed into one-line, immutably and as a result less prone to error.</p>

            <p>I recently had the chance to rewrite the backend of my <a href="http://github.com/eddmann/eddmann">personal website</a>.
I was surprised at how accustom I had become to using heavy-weight web frameworks (with plenty of accompanying depencies) in larger projects I am involved in, that I instead decided to do the complete opposite.
As a result, I built a very simple single-page Markdown file-based blogging platform (inc. pagination, caching) that only takes a few moments to read.
I find myself sometimes being blinded by the need to abstract everything with the Object-oriented philosophy, never taking the time to consider that in many cases it pays off to keep things simple.
Simple, single purpose functions that can be used for multiple use-cases within your application is a very good mind-set to try and incorporate.
In this post I wish to discuss a couple of the functions that I created to keep the file so simple.</p>
