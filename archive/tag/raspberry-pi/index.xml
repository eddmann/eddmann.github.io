After a little research, this past bank holiday weekend, I set myself the goal of building and deploying the web application on Kubernetes by the end of the Monday bank holiday!
In this post, I would like to discuss how I went about achieving this goal and what I learnt in the process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating a Time-lapse Camera with HypriotOS/Docker using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Raspberry Pi Zero W</title><link>https://eddmann.com/posts/creating-a-time-lapse-camera-with-hypriotos-docker-using-a-raspberry-pi-3b-plus-and-raspberry-pi-zero-w/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eddmann.com/posts/creating-a-time-lapse-camera-with-hypriotos-docker-using-a-raspberry-pi-3b-plus-and-raspberry-pi-zero-w/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have recently started a project that requires the ability to create a time-lapse video over a set duration.
Looking at all the possible ways of achieving this, I felt that a Raspberry Pi would be well suited for the job.
In this post, I will discuss how I went about setting up both a &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+&lt;/a> and a &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero W&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="https://blog.hypriot.com/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">HypriotOS&lt;/a> to run a Docker-based time-lapse camera Node application.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
