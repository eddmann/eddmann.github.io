<p>We have been a big fan of DataDog and the level of telemetry/monitoring it provides us for many years now.
One such aspect of monitoring that we employ throughout the services we maintain are <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/http_check/">HTTP health checks</a>, which are intentionally run on a separate cloud provider to our primary which is AWS.
DataDog has supplied the ability to handle running these checks via <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/">their agent</a> for many years, providing us with a sufficient blackbox means of ensuring a service is functioning as expected.
This past week we explored the viability of containerising this responsibility into a service which could be run on a Serverless platform such as the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform">DigitalOcean App Platform</a>.</p>
