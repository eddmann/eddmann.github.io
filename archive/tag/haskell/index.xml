I decided it would be interesting to model the machine within Haskell.
I felt solving the same problem in this manner would be a great way to compare and contrast Lisp and heavily-typed languages such as Haskell.
Through this process I also wanted to explore using Hspec and QuickCheck for comparable property-based testing that I achieved in the ClojureScript counterpart.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
