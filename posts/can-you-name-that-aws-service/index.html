Although I spend a lot of time working within AWS, I am always surprised to find yet another service that I did not know existed.
Better still, with each new service comes an associated new service icon.
This is why I thought it would be interesting (and somewhat educational) to build a small trivia game that quizzes you on AWS service icons.</p><p><a href=https://eddmann.com/name-that-aws-service/><picture><source type=image/webp srcset="/posts/can-you-name-that-aws-service/demo_hu_c128afd8acab7e3c.webp 350w, /posts/can-you-name-that-aws-service/demo_hu_580222edb240f965.webp 700w, /posts/can-you-name-that-aws-service/demo_hu_702034fe0efd6528.webp 1400w"><source type=image/jpeg srcset="/posts/can-you-name-that-aws-service/demo_hu_100ded4557d6c3e7.jpg 350w, /posts/can-you-name-that-aws-service/demo_hu_66d6d592e4648a98.jpg 700w, /posts/can-you-name-that-aws-service/demo_hu_940afd8d8473b230.jpg 1400w"><img src=/posts/can-you-name-that-aws-service/demo_hu_66d6d592e4648a98.jpg alt loading=lazy></picture></a></p><h2 id=finding-the-services>Finding the Services</h2><p>Instead of painstakingly crawling through all the available AWS services and associated icons, they fortunately provide an Architecture Icons <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>assets package</a>.
This artefact includes all the available named service icons, grouped by category.
Having found this, all that was required was to create a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/name-that-aws-service/blob/main/export-services.js rel="external noopener" target=_blank>small script</a> that exported this directory listing.
Thanks to the service icons being available in SVG format, I was able to keep this service definition contained in a single file.
Being in a deterministic form meant that future additions (because AWS is surely going to add more services!) could be performed in an automated fashion.
With the services now in a format we could query, it was time to build the game!</p><h2 id=building-the-game>Building the Game</h2><p>Thinking of the rules behind the game, I opted to keep it simple at this time.
Each day, a new quiz would be generated, consisting of ten service icons.
These service icons would each have four possible choices and an optional hint (the supplied category) that you could view.
The participants&rsquo; results would be stored within their web browsers&rsquo; local storage, providing a crude means of ensuring they only attempted the daily quiz once.
Like many developers, I have been amazed by the success of <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Wordle</a>.
With this, I took inspiration from the shared single daily quiz, which helps garner community discussion.</p><p>In a similar manner to how I built several small <a href=/posts/creating-a-contact-tracing-scanner-using-web-bluetooth/>web-based</a> <a href=/posts/building-a-nokia-composer-rtttl-player-and-wav-file-generator-in-the-browser/>applications</a> a couple of years ago, I decided to keep all the client-side React logic within a single <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/name-that-aws-service/blob/main/public/index.html rel="external noopener" target=_blank>HTML file</a>.
This makes it easier for someone who wishes to review the code and highlights how trivial such behaviour can be built using React.
Going forward, if additional, more complex behaviour is required, I may look to employ tooling such as <a href=https://create-react-app.dev/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Create React App</a>.</p><h2 id=generating-the-quiz>Generating the Quiz</h2><p>With the game being static in nature, I decided that hosting it using GitHub Pages would be a great fit.
With this, I also decided that I could harness GitHub Actions to generate the daily <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/name-that-aws-service/blob/main/generate-quiz.js rel="external noopener" target=_blank>random quiz</a> based on a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/name-that-aws-service/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate.yml rel="external noopener" target=_blank>scheduled workflow</a>.
Each morning, the workflow is executed, which in turn generates a new quiz and commits it to the GitHub repository.
This allows me to delegate the responsibility of hosting and compute to GitHub and only concern myself with the behaviour I wish to build.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Since building the quiz game, I have shared it across the team at MyBuilder and seen how well people know their AWS services!
Going forward, I would like to experiment with adding a Social Login component to the game, in which results can then be centrally stored and shared with other participants.</p></main><footer class=post__tags><a href=/archive/tag/aws>aws</a><a href=/archive/tag/react>react</a><a href=/archive/tag/javascript>javascript</a></footer></article><div class="related-posts prose"><h3>Related Posts</h3><ul><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-building-a-serverless-restful-api-and-react-client/>Mince Pie Challenge: Building a Serverless RESTful API and React Client</a></li><li><a href=/posts/building-a-flag-guessing-game-using-react-hooks/>Building a Flag Guessing Game using React Hooks</a></li><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-viewing-and-removing-mince-pies-with-amazon-dynamodb/>Mince Pie Challenge: Viewing and Removing Mince Pies with Amazon DynamoDB</a></li><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-adding-and-listing-mince-pies-with-amazon-dynamodb/>Mince Pie Challenge: Adding and Listing Mince Pies with Amazon DynamoDB</a></li><li><a href=/posts/creating-a-winning-audio-lambda-service-using-serverless-polly-and-compiled-sox/>Creating a 'Winning' Audio Lambda Service using Serverless, Polly and compiled SOX</a></li></ul></div><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer wrapper"><div>&copy; 2025, Edd Mann</div><button class=theme-toggle type=button title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg fill="currentcolor" viewBox="0 0 32 32" role="img"><title>Theme toggle icon</title><desc>A circle representing the moon for toggling theme</desc><path d="M16 .5C7.4.5.5 7.4.5 16S7.4 31.5 16 31.5 31.5 24.6 31.5 16 24.6.5 16 .5zm0 28.1V3.4C23 3.4 28.6 9 28.6 16S23 28.6 16 28.6z"/></svg></button></footer></body></html>
