            <p>Summation is the common operation of adding a sequence of numbers together, resulting in their total.
The trivial implementation is to iterate over the full collection of numbers, keeping a running total as you progress.
For small sequences, a single-threaded implementation will suffice.
However, when the size increases, the use of other available CPU cores helps to provide the necessary speed optimisations.
As addition is an associative operation, it makes no difference to the end result in which order we process the collection.
This behaviour works well for our implementation design.</p>

            <p>I recently decided to test my novice C skills in the field of building a PHP extension.
However, despite some very good resources (<a href="http://www.phpinternalsbook.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/303/extension-writing-part-i-introduction-to-php-and-zend/">here</a>), there still seems to be a lack of beginner-friendly material on the subject.
In this post I will document a simple development environment that has worked well on a fresh CentOS 6.5 installation.
Once this has been set up, we will then move on to creating a simple ‘Hello World’ extension, highlighting some of the extension platform’s capabilities.</p>

            <p>Iterative deepening depth-first search (IDDFS) is an extension to the ‘vanilla’ depth-first search algorithm, with an added constraint on the total depth explored per iteration.
It produces equivalent results to those achieved using breadth-first search, without incurring the large memory costs.
Due to breadth-first search storing fringe vertices in memory, O(b^d) memory space may be required (where b is the branching factor).
This is in stark contrast to IDDFS’s worst-case memory requirements of O(bd).
At each iteration, vertex successors at the depth-cap level are ignored.
If the goal has not been found, the maximum level is increased by one and the process repeated.
Similarly to breadth-first search, it guarantees finding an optimal path between two vertices, as the shallowest goal vertex is reached first due to the depth cap, resulting in no exploration of subsequent, unnecessary branches.</p>

            <p>Graph theory and, in particular, the graph ADT (abstract data type) is widely explored and implemented in the field of Computer Science and Mathematics.
Consisting of vertices (nodes) and the edges (optionally directed or weighted) that connect them, the data structure is effectively able to represent and solve many problem domains.
One of the most popular areas of algorithm design within this space is the problem of checking for the existence of, or the (shortest) path between, two or more vertices in the graph.</p>

            <p>Whilst uploading the <a href="http://threedevsandamaybe.com/">weekly podcast</a> I am required to produce a list of links discussed on the show.
This can become a little tedious, as I must visit each link to find a suitable title.
Additionally, when using Markdown, you must provide lists in a specific format.
I had been doing this manually for a couple of weeks, and last night I thought, “I am a developer; I should automate this.”.</p>
