<p>In the <a href="https://tech.mybuilder.com/mince-pie-challenge-adding-the-bootstrap-endpoint-and-serverless-offline/">previous post</a> we began to implement the API endpoints, starting off with creating the bootstrap response.
We did this in a manor that catered for both online and offline development access.
In this post we will incorporate the ability to add and list mince pies, persisting the state within <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>.
Following this, we will enrich our offline development process by setting up a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html">Amazon DynamoDB Local</a> instance using Docker.
