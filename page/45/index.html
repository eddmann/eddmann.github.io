            <p>I have been a part-time Git user for alittle over a year now, before this I had dabbled with using <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> but never for anything too serious.
I say part-time as throughout the year I never fully got to grips with all the ideologies/tools provided to aid in my development lifecyle process - in particular branching.</p>

            <p>I have been a loyal <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/">MAMP Pro</a> user for many years, I fell in love with how easy it was to setup custom hosts, without the need to tweak the hosts file myself.
However, ever since I documented my <a href="http://eddmann.com/posts/dnsmasq-your-local-development-dns/">experiences</a> with DNSMasq I have been intrested in how <a href="http://davidwinter.me/articles/2011/06/18/simple-local-web-development-with-apache-and-dnsmasq/">this</a> article documented setting up a web-stack with Apache similar to Ruby user’s <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a>.
The ability to setup a new development site with only the creation of a new folder (i.e. a folder called test could be accessible from test.dev) appealed to me greatly.</p>

            <p>It is becoming a scarily common occurence to read about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/us-news-blog/2012/jun/07/blogpost-eharmony-linkedin-hacked-leaked">yet</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18338956">another</a> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/257178/music_site_lastfm_joins_the_passwordleak_parade.html">batch</a> of high-profile websites user’s passwords being leaked online - for everyone’s cracking pleasure.
Whats even more shocking is how poorly these sites are storing them.
In regard to LinkedIn, it turned out that they had just stored them as un-salted, plan ‘ol MD5 hashes, that any Joe Bloggs could run a rainbow table over with extremely high success rates.
The tried and proven means of storing passwords in todays web applications is to create a hash from the user’s input, and then compare any attempted authentication with this stored value.
The trouble and confusion arises however in how to actually get to this end result, there are so many ‘wrong’ ways to go about it.</p>

            <p>I first became aware of database migrations a few years ago when I was exploring the world of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>.
However, it has not been to recently, with a gentle nudge from SE-Radio (<a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2012/06/episode-186-martin-fowler-and-pramod-sadalage-on-agile-database-development/">Episode 186</a>) and a large web application build that they have re-entered my development lifecycle.
As a result of current events I for one do not wish them to leave any time soon.</p>

            <p>Setting up a single-user web development environment is easy.
One-click (OS)AMP installers do all the work and internal domains are all stored in one easy to reach host file.
However, expanding this to a multi-user development team, all of which needing access to the same resources, is a whole different beast.
On-top of this, they may require access from multiple devices, some of which may not include a host file, such as a mobile phone.</p>
