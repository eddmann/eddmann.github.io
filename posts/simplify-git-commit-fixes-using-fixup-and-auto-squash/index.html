<p>Throughout a project I will typically make commits that could be categorised as fixes to previous commits.
To help highlight such commits I would follow the pattern of starting the message with ‘fix: …’, making the final rebase step (before merging into master) easier.
However, as time passed locating which ‘fix-commits’ related to other previous commits became harder to determine.
