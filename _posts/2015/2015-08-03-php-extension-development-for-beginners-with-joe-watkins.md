In the very first screencast episode of [Three Devs and a Maybe](http://threedevsandamaybe.com/), I was fortunate to chat with PHP core developer [Joe Watkins](http://blog.krakjoe.ninja/), discussing PHP 5 and 7 extension development for beginners. <!--more-->
Starting off by checking out the latest PHP source code from GitHub, we move on to installing the required development environment from scratch within Linux.
We then compile a basic CLI version of PHP for development purposes, verifying the installation using the provided tests.
Finally, we wrap up the show by creating a simple `array_sum` PHP extension clone using the provided `ext_skel`.
This example highlights the use of macros and common array-based actions that take place in a typical extension.
