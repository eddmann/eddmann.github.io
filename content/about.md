Hey there! I'm Edd üëãüèª, a problem-solver who enjoys programming.
With over 15 years of experience, I consider myself fortunate to work in a field I'm passionate about.
I'm always eager to explore and learn new technologies, sharing my insights and experiences on this blog and [podcast](https://compiledconversations.com/) along the way.

For a concise overview of my experience, see my [CV](/cv.html).

## Projects

Outside of work, I enjoy developing small projects to learn new technologies, showcasing them [here](./projects/index.md).
Some of my favorites from recent years include:

- [**santa-lang**](https://eddmann.com/santa-lang/): A functional, C-like programming language designed for solving Advent of Code puzzles.
- [**3x3x3 Rubik's Cube Solver**](https://eddmann.com/rubik-cube-solver/): A project written in Rust to algorithmically solve a standard Rubik's Cube.
- [**Our Wedding Website**](https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-website): A RSVP web-application - built using DDD, CQRS, Hexagonal Architecture, Event Sourcing, and deployed on AWS Lambda.
- [**Serverless Fargate**](https://www.serverless.com/plugins/serverless-fargate): A solution to maintain long-running Fargate ECS tasks within Serverless Framework.

## Podcasting

I currently host the [Compiled Conversations](https://compiledconversations.com/) podcast - in-depth conversations with the people shaping software and technology.

Each episode explores real-world experiences, technical challenges, and the thinking behind the tools, systems, and decisions that drive modern development.
From engineering practices to architectural choices, this is a show for developers who care about how software is built - and who's building it.

### Past Podcasting

From 2013 to 2019, I co-hosted the [Three Devs and a Maybe](https://threedevsandamaybe.com/) podcast, where we delved into various aspects of software development.
Initially focused on web technologies, the podcast evolved to cover a broad spectrum of topics, allowing me to engage with and learn from some truly remarkable individuals.
Memorable episodes include:
