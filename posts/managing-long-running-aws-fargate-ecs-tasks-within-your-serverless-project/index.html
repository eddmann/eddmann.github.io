The ability to concentrate efforts on only the code and infrastructure concerns that directly add business value is very powerful.
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offerings like AWS Lambda impose limitations that help in designing more fault-tolerant and scalable systems, leaning towards event-driven architectures.
However, there are times when we need to execute behaviour that exceeds common FaaS duration limits (i.e. AWS Lambda&rsquo;s 15-minute limit).
In this case, we ideally do not want to resort to a lower level of compute (i.e. a VPS such as EC2), but instead, be able to define and run such behaviour alongside our FaaS counterparts.
In this post, I would like to discuss a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/serverless-fargate rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Serverless Framework plugin</a> I have written, which aids in bridging this gap by way of ECS and <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>AWS Fargate</a>.</p><h2 id=why>Why?</h2><p>Over the past couple of weeks, I have been working on a personal project with some behaviour that, by design, does not fit into the 15-minute duration limit imposed by AWS Lambda.
Instead of being able to reengineer the problem into an event-driven architecture, it still needs to be run as a long-polling background process.
In a conventional compute setting, you would employ a <a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>service</a> or <a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>daemon</a> (by way of your choice of container orchestration platform) or possibly even manage an EC2 instance running a process control system such as <a href=http://supervisord.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Supervisor</a>.
However, in doing so, you lose the level of abstraction that Serverless and the Serverless Framework provide.
With the desire to maintain this level of abstraction, I investigated the possibility of using ECS/AWS Fargate, building additional functionality into the Serverless Framework (by way of a plugin) to bridge the divide between defining FaaS and container-based compute.</p><h2 id=what-is-aws-fargate>What is AWS Fargate?</h2><p>Fargate is a service offered by AWS that allows you to run containerised workloads at a similar level of abstraction as AWS Lambda does for functions.
In the case of AWS Lambda, you provide the code (or more recently, even a container image), whereas in the case of AWS Fargate, you provide the container image you wish to run.
This provides you with all the same Serverless benefits: a pay-as-you-go model, no upfront capacity planning, and built-in host-level VM separation for security concerns.</p><p>This level of compute can be used for both <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>ECS</a> and <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/eks/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>EKS</a> container orchestration platforms.
Upon review, I opted to use ECS, as this seemed to impose the least friction in both definition and execution of the desired behaviour.
Before we delve into the Serverless plugin itself, it would be useful to provide an overview of the constituent building blocks used to construct it:</p><ul><li><strong>Cluster</strong> - an isolated logical grouping of tasks or services that comprise your application.</li><li><strong>Task definition</strong> - defines one or more containers (with port and parameter configurations) that form your application.</li><li><strong>Task</strong> - instance(s) of a <em>Task definition</em>.</li><li><strong>Service</strong> - manages the desired number of a given task you wish to ensure is running at any one time.</li><li><strong>Scheduled task</strong> - handles executing a <em>Task</em> at a given time using <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>AWS EventBridge</a>.</li></ul><h2 id=the-serverless-plugin>The Serverless plugin</h2><p>Based on my new understanding of how ECS and Fargate work, I chose to take a step back and decide how, as an end user, I would like to declare a given <em>task</em> at the level of the Serverless Framework.
I wanted to take advantage of how the Serverless Framework was able to push built images to ECR, thanks to their <a href=https://www.serverless.com/blog/container-support-for-lambda rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Lambda container-runtime support</a>.
This meant that we could delegate this responsibility to the Framework and reference images in a similar manner to how users have grown accustomed to.
I also wanted to ensure that the execution task role created for the <em>tasks</em> honoured any <code>iamManagedPolicies</code> and <code>iamRoleStatements</code> declarations found within the provider, again adding parity with provisioned Lambda functions.
The resulting definition can be found within the <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/serverless-fargate#example rel="external noopener" target=_blank>GitHub repository</a>, detailing all the available configuration options.</p><p>The completed Serverless Framework plugin takes the declared <em>service/scheduled tasks</em> and generates the underlying CloudFormation resources needed to provision the compute upon deployment.
Using the Framework definition validation (backed by <a href=https://json-schema.org/ rel="external noopener" target=_blank>JSON Schema</a>), I was able to validate complex configurations supplied with ease.
Upon deployment, both the Lambda functions and Fargate tasks are provisioned within a single CloudFormation <em>stack</em>, with <em>task</em> ARNs being returned as outputs for extended use elsewhere.</p><h2 id=example-usage>Example usage</h2><p>To highlight all the capabilities of the plugin, I created a <a href=https://github.com/eddmann/serverless-fargate/tree/main/example rel="external noopener" target=_blank>contrived example</a> within the Serverless plugin repository.
This demonstrates how you can create three separate runtimes (PHP, Node, and Python) and run long-running behaviour alongside Lambda functions.
Additionally, if you do not wish to mix container task and function-layer runtimes (ensuring runtime parity), this can be achieved as follows:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>service</span>: <span style=color:#ae81ff>serverless-fargate</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Thanks to the extensible nature of the Serverless Framework plugin ecosystem, the DSL we have been able to construct almost feels native.
The above definition shows how a single application artifact image can be built and then subsequently run in both a Lambda function and a Fargate task setting.
For Fargate tasks, we are still able to use <a href=https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-base-images rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Lambda-compatible runtime images</a>, but we only need to override the entry point and desired command.
This allows you to maintain parity between application behaviour that requires different execution duration characteristics.</p><p>The only excess configuration that does not naturally fit into the Serverless model is the required VPC.
This is optional in a Lambda function-based definition, but due to AWS Fargate containers running within <code>awsvpc</code> network mode, we are required to supply a relevant VPC.
If Fargate tasks could optionally not require placement within a VPC (similar to Lambda functions), this would truly align with the Serverless methodology.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, I am very excited about how this plugin has progressed since its inception.
Having now been able to employ its use in the personal project I initially needed it for has highlighted how powerful it can be.
Going forward, I would like to add additional compute support for <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/bestpracticesguide/ec2-and-fargate-spot.html rel="external noopener" target=_blank>Fargate Spot</a> instances.
There are a couple of interesting technicalities in handling spot instances, which could be abstracted away by means of a plugin.
I hope to document this work in a future blog post.</p></main><footer class=post-footer><ul class="tags tags--large"><li><a href=/archive/tag/aws>aws</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/fargate>fargate</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/ecs>ecs</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/serverless>serverless</a></li><li><a href=/archive/tag/lambda>lambda</a></li></ul><div class=related><h3 class=related__title>Related Posts</h3><ul class=related__posts><li><a href=/posts/separating-out-the-lambda-bref-runtime-from-your-projects-composer-dependencies/>Separating out the Lambda Bref runtime from your project's Composer dependencies</a></li><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-viewing-and-removing-mince-pies-with-amazon-dynamodb/>Mince Pie Challenge: Viewing and Removing Mince Pies with Amazon DynamoDB</a></li><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-adding-and-listing-mince-pies-with-amazon-dynamodb/>Mince Pie Challenge: Adding and Listing Mince Pies with Amazon DynamoDB</a></li><li><a href=/posts/mince-pie-challenge-building-a-serverless-restful-api-and-react-client/>Mince Pie Challenge: Building a Serverless RESTful API and React Client</a></li><li><a href=/posts/creating-a-winning-audio-lambda-service-using-serverless-polly-and-compiled-sox/>Creating a 'Winning' Audio Lambda Service using Serverless, Polly and compiled SOX</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><div class="podcast-ad u-overlay-wrapper"><div class=podcast-ad__artwork><img src=https://compiledconversations.com/album-art.jpg alt="Compiled Conversations podcast album art" class=podcast-ad__artwork-image></div><div class=podcast-ad__content><h3 class=podcast-ad__title>Compiled Conversations</h3><p class=podcast-ad__description>Podcast I host, featuring conversations with the people shaping software and technology.</p><div class=podcast-ad__link>Check out the show</a></div><a class=u-overlay href=https://compiledconversations.com target=_blank>Listen to Compiled Conversations</a></div><div class=scroll-watcher></div></main><footer class="site-footer l-wrapper"><div>&copy; 2026, Edd Mann</div><button class=site-footer__theme-toggle type=button title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg fill="currentcolor" viewBox="0 0 32 32" role="img"><title>Theme toggle icon</title><desc>A circle representing the moon for toggling theme</desc><path d="M16 .5C7.4.5.5 7.4.5 16S7.4 31.5 16 31.5 31.5 24.6 31.5 16 24.6.5 16 .5zm0 28.1V3.4C23 3.4 28.6 9 28.6 16S23 28.6 16 28.6z"/></svg></button></footer></body></html>
